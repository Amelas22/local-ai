# Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue
The authentication middleware was returning "Invalid or inactive law firm" error even though the dev user existed in the database with a valid law_firm_id.

## Root Cause
The auth middleware was creating a mock user with a hardcoded `law_firm_id = "dev-firm-123"` when `AUTH_ENABLED=false` in development mode, but this law firm didn't exist in the database. The actual dev user in the database has `law_firm_id = "8bf7c6bb-934b-4f67-8afe-5f183a05520a"`.

## Solution
Modified the auth middleware (`/Clerk/src/middleware/auth_middleware.py`) to fetch the actual dev user from the database when in development mode instead of creating a mock user with hardcoded values.

### Changes Made:
1. When `AUTH_ENABLED=false` and the dev token is provided, the middleware now:
   - Fetches the actual dev user (id='dev-user-123') from the database
   - Uses the real law_firm_id from the database user
   - Falls back to mock user only if the database user doesn't exist or there's an error

## Testing
Created test scripts to verify the fix:
- `test_dev_auth_fixed.py` - Python script to test the authentication flow
- `quick_auth_test.ps1` - PowerShell script for quick testing
- `restart_clerk_with_auth_fix.ps1` - Script to restart the Clerk service
- `test_auth_in_clerk_container.ps1` - Script to run tests inside the container

## How to Apply the Fix:
1. The middleware has been updated
2. Restart the Clerk service: `./restart_clerk_with_auth_fix.ps1`
3. Test the authentication: `./quick_auth_test.ps1`

## Expected Behavior:
- The dev token should authenticate as the actual dev user from the database
- The user should have the correct law_firm_id: `8bf7c6bb-934b-4f67-8afe-5f183a05520a`
- Case creation and other operations should work without "Invalid or inactive law firm" errors
