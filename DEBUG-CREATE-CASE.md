## FEATURE:

Issue Summary
Case creation functionality fails when accessed through the Clerk frontend interface, resulting in terminal errors during the "Create Case" workflow.
Environment Details

Stack: Full Docker environment launched via python start_services.py --profile cpu
Frontend Access: Clerk frontend interface
User Action: Add Case → Input case data → Create Case button
Result: Terminal error messages posted below
All docker containers running error free

Expected Behavior

User clicks "Add Case"
Case creation form appears
User inputs case data (case name, client info, etc.)
User clicks "Create Case"
Case is successfully created and appears in case list
User can select the new case from dropdown

Actual Behavior
Case creation fails with terminal error messages below.

Debugging Investigation Plan


Common Root Causes to Investigate
Database Issues

Supabase tables not created (missing migration)
Qdrant collections not initialized
Database connection credentials incorrect
Case isolation metadata conflicts

API Endpoint Issues

Case creation endpoint not implemented
Request validation failing
Authentication/authorization errors
Missing CORS configuration

Docker Environment Issues

Services not fully started
Port conflicts or networking issues
Environment variables not properly set
Volume mount problems

Frontend Issues

Form validation errors
WebSocket connection required but not established
React state management issues
API client configuration errors

Expected Resolution Path

Fix the immediate case creation issue

Success Criteria

 Case creation completes without terminal errors
 New case appears in case dropdown list
 Case can be selected and used for document operations
 All Docker services remain healthy during operation
 Browser console shows no JavaScript errors
 API endpoints respond with appropriate success messages

file: docker-compose.yml
why: docker compose file for local development with tech stack and full services

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

Always make sure you are properly using socketio with React 19. Current implementation works.
The Clerk system is part of a tech stack that is run via the python start_services --profile cpu command. When rebuilding, make sure new services are added to the docker-compose.yml file. If a container needs to be rebuilt or restarted, ensure it remains part of the stack.
Always perform tests early and often.
