# Discovery Processing Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing Environment Variables
**Issue**: Discovery-specific environment variables were not set
**Fix**: Added to docker-compose configuration:
- `DISCOVERY_BOUNDARY_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini`
- `DISCOVERY_WINDOW_SIZE=5`
- `DISCOVERY_WINDOW_OVERLAP=1`
- `DISCOVERY_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.7`

### 2. Missing Methods in UnifiedDocumentManager
**Issue**: `is_duplicate()` and `add_document()` methods were missing
**Fix**: Added both methods to `unified_document_manager.py`

### 3. UnifiedDocument Model Validation Error
**Issue**: `search_text` field was required but missing when loading from storage
**Fix**: Added default value in `from_storage_dict()` method

### 4. EnhancedChunker Method Signature Mismatch
**Issue**: Called with wrong parameter names (`text` instead of `document_text`)
**Fix**: Updated to use correct parameters with DocumentCore object

## Current Status

The discovery processing pipeline is now:
1. ✅ Successfully splitting multi-document PDFs (18-20 documents found)
2. ✅ Emitting WebSocket events for each document found
3. ✅ Creating chunks for documents
4. ❓ Documents show as "processed: 0" despite processing occurring

## Remaining Issues

The main remaining issue is that documents aren't being marked as successfully processed. This appears to be due to:
- Errors during the embedding/storage phase
- The chunk storage method signature may be incorrect

## How to Test

1. Run the comprehensive test:
```bash
docker exec clerk python /app/test_discovery_full.py
```

2. Monitor WebSocket events:
```bash
docker exec clerk python /app/test_websocket_discovery.py
```

3. Check logs for specific processing:
```bash
docker logs clerk 2>&1 | grep "processing_id" | tail -50
```

## Next Steps

To complete the fix:
1. Debug the chunk storage phase
2. Ensure embeddings are generated correctly
3. Fix the document processed count increment
4. Verify WebSocket events reach the frontend

## Files Modified

1. `/app/src/api/discovery_endpoints.py` - Added logging, fixed method calls
2. `/app/src/document_processing/unified_document_manager.py` - Added missing methods
3. `/app/src/models/unified_document_models.py` - Fixed model validation
4. `docker-compose.clerk-discovery.yml` - Added environment variables
5. `docker-compose.clerk-dev.yml` - Added volume mount for development
