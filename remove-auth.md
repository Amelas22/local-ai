## FEATURE:

Remove Auth Middleware for MVP Development

Some context: 
This auth component we've built has caused a ton of
  issues during development as each time we build something new it leads us to debug the auth part
  again and again. My goal is to develop a MVP of this product to present to premoney investors with no
   real intent of going into full production just yet. I'm running this through a simple docker
  desktop. How important is this auth part for development? How difficult will it be to implement it
  later once more of the processes and workflows are actually impelmented

‚óè You raise an excellent point. Let me analyze the authentication situation for your MVP development:

  Current Auth Implementation Issues

  The auth system is causing repeated development friction because:
  1. Middleware ordering conflicts - Auth middleware, case context middleware, and API endpoints all
  need to coordinate
  2. Dev token validation - Even with AUTH_ENABLED=false, the system still expects proper token
  handling
  3. Cascading dependencies - Every new feature needs to work around auth requirements
  4. Testing overhead - Can't easily test features without dealing with auth first

  How Important is Auth for MVP Development?

  For an MVP to show investors, authentication is not critical if you're:
  - Running locally on Docker Desktop
  - Doing controlled demos
  - Focusing on core legal AI features
  - Not handling real client data yet

  What matters for investors:
  - Core functionality - Discovery processing, motion drafting, search
  - AI capabilities - Fact extraction, legal document understanding
  - User experience - Smooth workflows, real-time updates
  - Value proposition - How it solves legal workflow problems

  How Difficult to Implement Later?

  Adding auth later is relatively straightforward because:

  1. Clean integration points - FastAPI middleware system makes it easy to add/remove
  2. Existing foundation - You already have the auth middleware, just disabled
  3. Standard patterns - JWT auth is well-understood
  4. Isolated concern - Auth doesn't change your core business logic

  The main work later would be:
  - Enabling the existing auth middleware
  - Adding proper user management UI
  - Implementing password reset flows
  - Adding role-based permissions
  - Integrating with SSO providers (if needed)

  Recommendation for MVP

  I'd suggest completely removing auth for now:

  1. Remove auth middleware entirely - Not just disable, but comment it out
  2. Hardcode a dev user context - Always inject a mock user for case isolation
  3. Focus on features - Build discovery processing, motion drafting, etc.
  4. Add auth last - Once core features are solid

  This would eliminate the constant auth debugging and let you move faster on features that actually
  matter to investors.

  Would you like me to create a plan to:
  1. Completely bypass auth for development
  2. Ensure all features work without auth
  3. Keep the auth code ready but inactive for future use

  This approach would let you focus on building the impressive legal AI features without the auth
  friction.

## EXAMPLES:

1. Comment out auth middleware in main.py

  # main.py lines 136-145
  # TEMPORARILY DISABLED FOR MVP DEVELOPMENT
  # from src.middleware.auth_middleware import AuthMiddleware
  # from config.settings import settings
  # app.add_middleware(AuthMiddleware)

  # Add Case Context Middleware (must be after auth)
  from src.middleware.case_context import CaseContextMiddleware
  app.add_middleware(CaseContextMiddleware)

2. Create a mock user provider for development

  # src/middleware/mock_user_middleware.py
  from fastapi import Request
  from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware

  class MockUserMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
      """Inject mock user for MVP development - REMOVE IN PRODUCTION"""

      async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
          # Always inject dev user context
          request.state.user_id = "dev-user-123"
          request.state.user_email = "dev@clerk.ai"
          request.state.user_name = "Development User"
          request.state.law_firm_id = "dev-firm-123"
          request.state.is_admin = True

          # Mock user object for compatibility
          from types import SimpleNamespace
          request.state.user = SimpleNamespace(
              id='dev-user-123',
              email='dev@clerk.ai',
              name='Development User',
              law_firm_id='dev-firm-123',
              is_active=True,
              is_admin=True
          )

          response = await call_next(request)
          return response

  # In main.py, add this instead of AuthMiddleware:
  app.add_middleware(MockUserMiddleware)

3. Update frontend to remove auth service

// frontend/src/services/api.client.ts
// Comment out auth token logic
const apiClient = axios.create({
    baseURL: API_BASE_URL,
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      // MVP: No auth needed
      // 'Authorization': `Bearer ${getToken()}`
    },
  });

  // Remove token refresh interceptor
  // apiClient.interceptors.response.use(...)

4. Update Docker environment

# docker-compose.yml - Remove auth-related env vars
clerk:
    environment:
      # MVP Mode - No Auth
      - MVP_MODE=true
      # - AUTH_ENABLED=false  # Remove entirely
      # - DEV_MOCK_TOKEN=dev-token-123456  # Remove entirely

5. Simplify API endpoints that check permissions

# src/api/discovery_endpoints.py
@router.post("/process", response_model=DiscoveryProcessingResponse)
async def process_discovery(
      background_tasks: BackgroundTasks,
      # MVP: Simplified - no auth dependency
      # case_context: CaseContext = Depends(require_case_context("write")),
      case_id: str = Form(...),  # Just pass directly for MVP
      discovery_files: List[UploadFile] = File(None),
      # ... other params
  ):
      # MVP: Create simple context
      case_context = SimpleNamespace(
          case_id=case_id,
          case_name=case_id,  # Use same value for simplicity
          user_id="dev-user-123"
      )

Key Patterns to Search For:

- Depends(require_case_context - Replace with simple parameter
- Depends(get_case_context) - Replace with mock context
- request.state.user - Ensure mock user is always available
- Authorization headers - Remove from frontend
- AUTH_ENABLED - Remove all references

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

1. Case Isolation Still Required

Even without auth, the system needs case isolation for multi-tenant data separation. The mock user
should always have a consistent law_firm_id to maintain this isolation.

2. WebSocket Connections

The WebSocket server may expect auth tokens. Need to modify:
# src/websocket/socket_server.py
# Remove token validation in connect handler

3. Database Seed Data

Ensure the dev user and law firm exist in the database:
-- These should already exist from init_db.py
INSERT INTO law_firms (id, name) VALUES ('dev-firm-123', 'Development Firm');
INSERT INTO users (id, email, law_firm_id) VALUES ('dev-user-123', 'dev@clerk.ai', 'dev-firm-123');

4. Frontend State Management

The frontend Redux store expects user info. Mock this in the initial state:
// frontend/src/store/index.ts
const mockUser = {
    id: 'dev-user-123',
    email: 'dev@clerk.ai',
    name: 'Development User',
    isAuthenticated: true  // Always true for MVP
  };

5. Re-enabling Auth Later

Keep the original auth files but renamed:
- auth_middleware.py.production
- auth.service.ts.production

This makes it easy to restore full auth by renaming back and uncommenting the middleware.

6. Security Warning Banner

Add a visible banner in the UI indicating this is an MVP without authentication:
// frontend/src/components/common/Layout.tsx
{process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && (
    <Alert severity="warning">
      MVP Mode - No Authentication Active
    </Alert>
  )}

7. API Error Handling

Some error handlers expect 401/403 responses. Update to handle MVP mode:
// frontend/src/services/api.client.ts
// Don't redirect to login on 401 in MVP mode
if (error.response?.status === 401 && !MVP_MODE) {
    // Handle auth error
  }

8. Potential Gotchas

- Some components may directly import auth services - need to stub these
- Tests that check auth behavior will need updates
- Admin panel routes may have hard-coded permission checks
- File upload endpoints may validate user permissions
