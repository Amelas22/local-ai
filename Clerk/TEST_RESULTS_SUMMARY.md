# Discovery Processing Test Results

## Test Execution Summary

### ✅ Tests Successfully Run

1. **Discovery Integration Tests** (`test_discovery_integration.py`)
   - ✅ `test_process_discovery_empty_files` - PASSED
   - ✅ `test_process_discovery_with_box_folder` - PASSED
   - ✅ `test_get_processing_status_integration` - PASSED
   - ❌ `test_process_discovery_json_request` - FAILED (BackgroundTasks mock issue)

2. **WebSocket Event Verification**
   - ✅ Events are properly emitted during processing
   - ✅ Event sequence: `discovery:started` → `discovery:completed`
   - ✅ Socket.io integration working correctly

3. **Module Import Tests**
   - ✅ Discovery endpoints module loads successfully
   - ✅ All required models and dependencies importable
   - ✅ FastAPI router properly configured

## Key Findings

### What's Working:
1. **API Endpoint Structure** - The discovery processing endpoint is properly set up and accepts requests
2. **WebSocket Integration** - Real-time events are emitted correctly during processing
3. **Error Handling** - Empty file scenarios and missing data are handled gracefully
4. **Processing Status** - Status tracking and retrieval working as expected

### Test Challenges:
1. **Mock Mismatches** - Some tests reference classes that were refactored (`NormalizedDiscoveryProductionProcessor`)
2. **Function Signatures** - The actual `_process_discovery_async` function has different parameters than the test expected
3. **Background Tasks** - Some tests expect background task scheduling that may not be implemented

## Actual Test Output

```bash
# Running discovery integration tests
docker-compose -p localai exec clerk python -m pytest src/api/tests/test_discovery_integration.py -v

# Results:
- 3 passed ✅
- 1 failed ❌
- 122 warnings (mostly deprecation warnings)
- Total time: 13.33s
```

## WebSocket Events Confirmed

During test execution, the following events were observed:
```
emitting event "discovery:started" to all [/]
emitting event "discovery:completed" to all [/]
```

## Code Coverage Areas

### Tested:
- ✅ Empty file handling
- ✅ Box folder integration
- ✅ Processing status retrieval
- ✅ WebSocket event emission
- ✅ Basic error scenarios

### Not Fully Tested (Due to Implementation Differences):
- ❓ Document splitting logic (requires actual PDF processing)
- ❓ Fact extraction per document
- ❓ Multi-document boundary detection
- ❓ Chunk creation and embedding

## Recommendations

1. **Update Test Mocks** - Align test mocks with actual implementation:
   - Remove references to `NormalizedDiscoveryProductionProcessor`
   - Update function signatures to match implementation
   - Fix background task mocking

2. **Integration Testing** - For full validation:
   - Use actual PDF files
   - Test with real Qdrant instance
   - Verify OpenAI integration

3. **Frontend Testing** - Test the React components:
   - Tab creation for discovered documents
   - Real-time fact display
   - PDF viewer integration

## Conclusion

The discovery processing infrastructure is in place and partially working:
- ✅ API endpoints are functional
- ✅ WebSocket events are emitting
- ✅ Basic processing flow is implemented
- ⚠️ Document splitting integration needs to be completed per the PRP

The tests demonstrate that the foundation is solid, but the full document splitting and per-document processing workflow described in the PRP still needs to be implemented in the backend.
