**PLAINTIFF’S OBJECTION TO DEFENDANT, NORTH AMERICAN TRANSPORT
SERVICES, LLC’S MOTION FOR PARTIAMEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OFL JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS AND ASSERTING ACTIVE NEGLIGENCE
AGAINST DEFENDANT, NORTH AMERICAN TRANSPORT SERVICES, LLC**
Plaintiff, TEESHA ADAMS, as Personal Representative of the Estate of ROBERT
ADAMS, JR., (hereinafter “Plaintiff”), by and through the undersigned counsel files this Objection
to Defendant, NORTH AMERICAN TRANSPORT SERVICES, LLC’s Motion for Partial
Judgment on the Pleadings and Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiff asserting an Active
Negligence Cause of Action (Count II) against Defendant, NORTH AMERICAN TRANSPORT
SERVICES, LLC, (“NATS”), despite NATS’ admission of vicarious liability, and says for the
reasons set forth below:
**INTRODUCTION**
This action arises out of an August 21, 2021 collision as ROBERT ADAMS, JR. was
traveling southbound on U.S. 321, Lexington County South Carolina when a tractor-trailer driven
by Defendant SALVADOR DACOSTA, indisputably in the course and scope of employment with

NATS, under the admitted operating authority of NATS, at approximately 3:50 a.m., negligently
stopped the tractor-trailer in the travel lane in front of the Plaintiff causing the Plaintiff to collide
with the rear of the tractor-trailer. As a result of the collision, ROBERT ADAMS, JR. suffered
catastrophic injuries resulting in his death.

Unfortunately, MR. DACOSTA’s actions in making a dangerous stop within a travel lane
at 3:50 in the morning was foreseeable, given the complete lack of supervision, monitoring and
training NATS averred over MR. DACOSTA combined with the pressure on MR. DACOSTA to
timely complete a route and deliver cargo, and this was a disaster waiting to happen. As an
interstate motor carrier, NATS owed a duty to take steps to prevent injury or death to the driving
public, like Plaintiff, ROBERT ADAMS, JR.
Nevertheless, NATS failed to appreciate the dangers of their actions and prioritized its
profit and the cargo being transported over the safety of other motorists when they took steps to
supervise, monitor and train MR. DACOSTA and overloaded his route the day of the crash with
numerous stops, taking unfamiliar driving routes across South Carolina as evidenced by the
multiple times MR. DACOSTA stopped at truck stops in the early hours of August 21, 2021 prior
to stopping in the travel lane of U.S. 321. These negligent actions resulted in the catastrophic
injuries and death of ROBERT ADAMS, JR.
**PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**
On March 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed her Complaint (DE # 2). Plaintiff’s Complaint set forth
the following three causes of action:

1. Count I – Active Negligence against Defendant SALVADOR DACOSTA;
2. Count II – Active Negligence against NATS;
3. Count III – Vicarious Liability against NATS pursuant to the Dangerous
Instrumentality Doctrine; 4. Count IV – Vicarious Liability Against NATS – Respondeat Superior;
5. Count V - Active Negligence Against Ryder Truck Rental, Inc.;


6. Count VI - Vicarious Liability Against Ryder Truck Rental, Inc. - Dangerous
Instrumentality; and
7. Count VII - Vicarious Liability Against Ryder – Respondeat Superior
_See,_ Plaintiff’s Complaint (DE # 2).
Within Count II of the Complaint, Plaintiff specifically states claims against NATS for
negligent hiring, monitoring, supervision, training and retaining of MR. DACOSTA.
This Court should deny Defendant NATS’s request to eliminate Plaintiff’s active
negligence cause of action against NATS for the following reasons:
1. Florida Courts allow active negligence claims to be asserted against an employer
where a Plaintiff also established vicarious liability under _respondeat superior_.
2. State and Federal Courts across the Country refuse to bar direct negligence claims
based on vicarious liability admission.
3. Plaintiff has properly stated claims against NATS for negligent training and supervision
of MR. DACOSTA in connection with the negligence committed by MR. DACOSTA
within the scope of his employment with NATS.
4. Cases Defendant NATS most rely on to support their contention to eliminate an active
negligence cause of action, such as _: Clooney v. Geeting_ , 352 So.2d 1216 (Fla. 2d DCA
1977) are not binding or persuasive.
5. NATS explicitly denies MR. DACOSTA’s liability and has admitted that it is
vicariously liable for MR. DACOSTA’s under of DACOSTA. _respondeat superior_ for the negligence

**I. Florida Courts allow active negligence claims to be asserted against an employer
where a Plaintiff also established vicarious liability.**
Florida’s system of comparative fault mandates that, when apportioning fault, the jury
considers all acts of negligence that contributed to injuries or death, including NATS’s negligent
supervision, monitoring and training. At one time, Florida law recognized joint and several
liability amongst tortfeasors whereby each defendant was severally liable for payment of all of
plaintiff’s damages regardless of the defendant’s percentage of fault. This changed when the


Florida Legislature enacted § 768.81, Fla. Stat. in 1986 and adopted pure comparative negligence,
and then again in 2018 when it amended §768.81 to abolish joint and several liability.
The purpose and policies behind section § 768.81, Fla. Stat., were discussed in _Fabre v.
Marin_ , where the Florida Supreme Court held that “[l]iability is to be determined on the basis of
percentage of fault of each participant to the accident....” 623 So. 2d 1182, 1186 (Fla. 1993). In
adopting comparative negligence and eliminating joint and several liability, the Florida Supreme
Court and the Legislature expressly and conclusively established that fault must be apportioned
between all entities whose negligence may have caused or contributed to plaintiff’s injuries.
Moreover, a defendant is only liable for his or her percentage of fault.
The court in _Dumore v. Eagle Motor Lines_ , 560 So. 2d 1261 (Fla. 1st DCA 1990), explained
how the allocation of comparative negligence works in a tractor-trailer crash case. There, the
decedent was run over by a commercial truck leased by Eagle to Pitts, entrusted to and driven by
Pitts in the course and scope of Pitts’ employment with Pitts Trucking. Plaintiff asserted claims
for negligent entrustment against Eagle, negligent operation against Pitts and vicarious liability
against Pitts Trucking. Dunmore’s negligent entrustment claim alleged, among other things, that
the defendant knew or should have known by reason of the driver’s past driving record that he was
unfit to operate a motor vehicle. The trial court severed the trial of plaintiff’s claims against the
driver and employer from the plaintiff’s claim against Eagle for negligent entrustment. The First
DCA ruled that the trial court improperly severed the trials, which impacted the apportionment of
liability under the comparative fault statute.
In _Trevino v. Mobley_ , 63 So. 3d 865, 867 (Fla. 5th DCA 2011), the Fifth District Court of
Appeal held that a direct negligence claim against a vehicle owner must be allowed to proceed
where some liability may be imposed on the vehicle owner above and beyond that for which that


owner might be vicariously liable. One judge filed the following one-sentence concurrence: “This
case demonstrates why the decision in _Clooney v. Geeting_^1 , 352 So.2d 1216 (Fla. 2d DCA 1977),
should be abandoned and no longer followed by the courts in this state.”
Accordingly, in the instant case, the jury must be afforded the opportunity to apportion the
fault for the crash to all of the parties based on their relative percentage of fault for the accident.
Indeed, the defendants have raised comparative negligence, and, therefore, the relative fault of the
plaintiff must also be determined. If the crash was caused in part by the fault of NATS in
negligently supervising, monitoring and training MR. DACOSTA, the jury is entitled to hear
evidence of this fault, which is separate and distinct from the fault of MR. DACOSTA and
apportion the fault between all of the parties. Moreover, due to the elimination of joint and several
liability, the defendants are _only_ responsible for their percentage of fault, which makes the
allocation of fault that much more significant.

**II. State and Federal Courts across the Country refuse to bar direct negligence
claims based on vicarious liability admission.**
Courts across the country refuse to bar direct negligence claims based on a defendant’s
admission of vicarious liability.^2 For example, at least ten state supreme courts – Georgia, Illinois,
Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, South Carolina, and Utah^3 – have

refused to dismiss the direct negligence claims based on an admission of vicarious liability, five
of them within the last four years. Many state and federal trial and lower appellate courts also
have refused to bar direct negligence claims based on an admission of vicarious liability.^4 For
instance, in _James v. Kelly Trucking Co._ , the South Carolina Supreme Court confirmed an
independent claim for negligent training, and supervision of a truck driver, even though the
trucking company admitted to _respondeat superior_ liability for the driver’s negligence. The _James_
court held in pertinent part:

```
Just as an employee can act to cause another’s injury in a tortious
manner, so can an employer be independently liable in tort. In
circumstances where an employer knew or should have known that
its employment of a specific person created an undue risk of harm
to the public, a plaintiff may claim that the employer was itself negligent in hiring, supervising, or training the employee, or that the
employer acted negligently in entrusting its employee with a tool
that created an unreasonable risk of harm to the public. As this
recitation suggests, the employer’s liability under such a theory does
not rest on the negligence of anegligence. Stated differently, the employer’s liability under this nother, but on the employer’s own

(^) In our view, it is a rather strange proposition that a stipulation as to
one cause of action could somehow “prohibit” completely the
pursuit of another. A plaintiff may, in a single lawsuit, assert many
causes of action against a defendant. The considerations limiting a
plaintiff’s available causes of action in the typical case are that the plaintiff must be able to demonstrate a prima facie case for each
cause of action and that a plaintiff may only recover once for an
injury. Thus, although an Insurer’s stipulation as to vicarious
liability ensures that the Insurer (standing in the shoes of [defendant
trucking company]) will beonly the practical effect of the stipulation. Such practical liable for the [plaintiffs’] injuries, that is
considerations, in our opinion, ought not require the preclusion of a
claim based upon [defendant trucking company’s] alleged
negligence in hiring [the driver] as a matter of law.
661 S.E.2d 329, 330-32 (internal citations^ omitted and emphasis added).
More recently, in 2021, the Utah Supreme Court held that Utah’s comparative fault statute
would not permit an employer “to use _respondeat superior_ as an off-ramp from having fault
apportioned to it directly for its own negligent acts” in employing a driver with a history of
accidents.^5 In 2022, the Illinois Supreme Court held that a plaintiff may proceed with actions
against an employer under both direct negligence and vicarious liability theories of liability.^6 And,
in 2024, the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled that “Tennessee’s system of modified comparative
fault and certain well-established principles of Tennessee jurisprudence” allowed plaintiff “to
proceed with a direct negligence claim against an employer even after the employer admits to
being vicariously liable for the actions of its employee.”^7
A jury cannot perform one of its most basic functions—determining liability and
apportioning fault among responsible parties—if evidence of an employer’s negligence has been

suppressed. Without evidence of the employer’s actual negligence, the jury would be forced to
allocate fault without complete evidence of negligence. Other litigants must absorb any percentage
that would otherwise be assigned to the employer’s independent negligence. In this scenario,
plaintiffs and defendant drivers would be forced to pay for more than their share of damages, and
employers would be permitted to escape any independent responsibility for their negligence, even
though each party’s negligence in causing the injury is unique.^8
In this case, NATS installed inward facing and outward facing onboard cameras in NATS’s
trucks to monitor both travelling activities and driver activities while driving their tractor-trailers.
When the camera triggers an event, NATS is notified of the event.
NATS was responsible for reviewing the filmed adverse trigger events. MR. DACOSTA
drove the tractor-trailer in the dark early morning of August 21, 2021. The video shows that
DACOSTA stopped his truck in the travel lane and DACOSTA reached for his cell phone. NATS
in the course of monitoring and supervising its drivers was on notice of such impermissible actions.
The use of the handheld device is a violation of the FMCSRs and NATS’ company policies.
Along with failing to monitor and supervise MR. DACOSTA’s activities or coach him on
his impermissible behavior, NATS compounded MR. DACOSTA’s dangerous propensity when
NATS overloaded his route the day of the crash with numerous stops, taking unfamiliar driving
routes across South Carolina. The post-crash Driver/Vehicle Examination Report issued by South
Carolina State Transport Police notes an out of service violation for FMCSR 395.8(e)(1) for false
report of driver’s record of duty status, false log on 8/21/21. The evidence adduced in the early

stages of discovery shows that DACOSTA made several stops at truck stops such as a Flying J
location. Despite the prior stops, DACOSTA continued to drive the tractor-trailer and falsified his
logs along the way. NATS failed to properly supervise, monitor and train DACOSTA which
directly contributed to the subject fatal collision.
Prohibiting Plaintiff from pursuing independent causes of action gives NATS—and all
negligent, unsafe trucking companies—the power to insulate themselves from liability for their
actions and omissions simply by admitting that they are vicariously liable for their drivers’
negligent acts. This result not only frustrates the basic premise of tort law, which is to encourage
companies to engage in safe, careful, responsible behavior, but it also prohibits plaintiffs from
moving forward with well-pled claims in an “unnecessarily harsh” way.^9 As the Kentucky
Supreme Court teaches in _MV Transport., Inc. v. Allegeier_ :
[P]laintiff may assert and pursue in the same action a claim against
an employer based under negligence, and a separate claim based upon the employer’s own _respondeat superior_ upon the agent’s
direct negligence in hiring, retention, supervision, or training. **The
employer’s admission to the existence of an agency relationship
from which vicarious liability may arise does not supplant the
claim that the employer’s own nenegligence of the employee, may have caused or contributed to gligence, independent of the
the injury**.^10

**III. Plaintiff has properly stated claims against NATS for negligent hiring,
training, supervision, monitoring and retention of MR. DACOSTA in
connection with the negligence committed by MR. DACOSTA within the scope
of his employment with NATS.**
Florida law absolutely allows an employer to be sued for negligent supervision and training
where the employee commits a foreseeable tort within the scope of his employment. The basis for
these causes of action is Restatement (Second) of Agency 2d § 213. This Restatement has been
adopted in Florida. _See Storm v. Town of Ponce Inlet_ , 866 So. 2d 713 (Fla. 5th DCA 2004). This
Restatement is titled “Principal Negligent or Reckless” and provides:
A person conducting an activity through servants or other agents is subject to
liability for harm resulting his conduct if he is negligent or reckless: (a) in giving
improper or ambiguous orders or in failing to make proper regulations; or (b) in the
employment of improper persharm to others; (c) in the supervision of the activity; or ons or instrumentalities in(d) in permitting, or failing work involving risk of
to prevent, negligent or other tortious conduct by persons, whether or not his
servants or agents, upon premises or with instrumentalities under his control.
This Restatement expressly sets forth the basis for a negligent training claim (Subsection (a)), a
negligent hiring claim (Subsection (b)), and negligent supervision claim (Subsection (c)). There
is no requirement to assert a direct claim of negligence against an employer, that the employee
commit an intentional tort or that the tort be committed outside the scope of employment. _See R.A.
ex rel. N.A. v. First Church of Christ_ , 748 A.2d 692, 697 (Pa. Super. 2000) (the Restatements
“impose on an employer the duty to exercise reasonable care in selecting, supervising, and
controlling employees.”)
The comments to Restatement § 213 are instructive. Comment d. provides as follows:
Agent dangerous. The principal may be negligent because he has reason to know
that the servant or other agent, because of his qualities, is likely to harm others in
view of the work or instrumentalities entrusted to him. If the dangerous quality of
the agent causes harm, the principal may be liable under the rule that one initiating
conduct having an undue tendency to cause harm is liable therefor. _See,_
Restatement of Torts, § 308.


The dangerous quality in the agent may consist of his incompetence or
unskillfulness due to his youth or his lack of experience considered with reference
to the act to be performed. An agent, although otherwise competent, may be
incompetent because of his reckless or vicious disposition, and if a principal,
without exercising due care in selection, employs a vicious person to do an act
which necessarily brings him in contact with others while in the performance of a
duty, he is subject to liability for harm caused by the vicious propensity. The
negligence may be in entrusting an agent with instrumentalities which, in
connection with his known propensities and the qualities of the instrumentalities,
constitute an undue risk to third persons. These propensities may be either
viciousness, thoughtlessness, or playfulness.
One who employs another to act for him is not liable under the rule stated in this
Section merely because the one employed is incompetent, vicious, or careless. If
liability results it is because, under the circumstances, the employer has not taken
the care which a prudent man would take in selecting the person for the business in
hand. What precautions must be taken depend upon the situation. One can
normally assume that another who offers to perform simple work is competent. If,
however, the work is likely to subject third persons to serious risk of great harm,
there is a special duty of investigation.
Liability results under the rule stated in this Section, not because of the relation of
the parties, but because the employer antecedently had reason to believe that an
undue risk of harm would exist because of the employment. The employer is
subject to liability only for such harm as is within the risk. If, therefore, the risk
exists because of the quality of the employee, there is liability only to the extent
that the harm is caused by the quality of the employee which the employer had
reason to suppose would be likely to cause harm.
As made clear by comment d., an employer can be held liable for negligently hiring and
retaining an employee that causes harm while acting within the scope of employment if the
employer does not exercise prudent care in hiring, supervising and training an employee to conduct
work that subjects third persons to serious risk or harm. MR. DACOSTA’s employment duties as
a tractor-trailer driver involved the risk of serious harm to third parties, including the
Plaintiff/decedent, ROBERT ADAMS, JR.
Plaintiff alleges negligent training, monitoring and supervision of MR. DACOSTA. The
comments to Restatement 213 are further instructive on these issues.


Comment g. discusses negligent training and provides:
Inadequate regulations. A master is negligent if he fails to use care to provide such
regulations as are reasonabpersons or to other servants from the ly necessary to prevent undueconduct of those working under him. See § risk of harm to third
508 and the Restatement of Torts, § 317. One who engages in an enterprise is under
a duty to anticipate and to guard against the human traits of his employees which
unless regulated are likely to harm others. He is likewise required to make such
reasonable regulations as the size or co mplexity of his business may require.
This comment sets the grounds for Plaintiff’s negligent training allegations. NATS was under a
duty to anticipate the risks accompanying MR. DACOSTA’s employment as a tractor-trailer driver
and to train him, which would include verifying he understood that stopping in a travel lane and
using a handheld device on a dark roadway at 3:50 in the morning were expressly prohibited and
dangerous when there was no mechanical defect of the tractor-trailer, and to safely operate the
tractor-trailer. Plaintiff has properly stated a claim for negligent training, monitoring and
supervision of MR. DACOSTA.
Finally, comment h. sets forth the rule for concurrent, separate negligence claims against
NATS for active negligence and vicarious liability. This comment provides:
Concurrent negligence of maststated in this Section, a master may also er and servant. In addition be subject to liabilityto liability under the rule if the act occurs
within the scope of employment. See §§ 219- 267. In a given case the employer
may be liable both on the ground that he was personally negligent and on the ground
that the conduct was within the scope of employment. In such cases, the fact that
the employer was personally negligent may in which punitive damages are awarded. See § 217C. Likewise an employer may be important, however, in jurisdictions
be subject to a penalty. See § 217D. Furthermore, in actions in which both the
employer and the employee are joined because of conduct of the employee, a
verdict finding the employee not liable and the employer liable may be supported
if there is evidence of personal negligence on the part of the employer. See § 217B.

This comment confirms that an employer may be liable concurrently for its own active negligence
and under _respondeat superior_ if the tort is committed within the scope of employment. While
the comment mentions the importance of this rule with respect to punitive damages, it is also


significant under Florida’s comparative negligence statute in which the jury has the obligation to
apportion fault to all of the parties. _See also Petrick v. New Hampshire Ins. Co.,_ 379 So. 2d 1287
(Fla. 1st DCA 1979) (“Negligent hiring and employment are legitimate bases for recovery.
Moreover, both the agent and principal are subject to suit for their own respective negligence”)_._
Thus, under this Restatement, Plaintiff is entitled to pursue claims against NATS for its
active negligence in training and supervising MR. DACOSTA. Nothing in the Restatement
requires MR. DACOSTA’s torts to be intentional or to be committed outside the scope of his
employment. While there are cases which suggest that tortious conduct must be outside the scope
of employment, none of these cases reference or analyze the Restatement of Agency cited above.
They only rely on Restatement 317, which provides an additional theory of active liability to hold
an employer liable for a dangerous employee, not an exclusive theory of active liability. As such,
applying Restatement 317 cases to a dangerous tractor-trailer or tractor-trailer driver on our
roadways would be improper. To the extent other courts have fallen for this argument, those cases
were wrongly decided.
To explain why, an analysis of the history of the Restatement 317 cases in Florida is
necessary. The genesis for holding employers liable for the conduct of their employees outside
the scope of employment is the Florida Supreme Court’s opinion in _Mallory v. O’Neil_ , 69 So. 2d
213 (Fla. 1954). In this case, the Florida Supreme Court faced the question of whether an employer
could be held liable for the tortious conduct of its employee conducted outside the scope of his
employment. There, an apartment building owner hired a maintenance man who shot someone in
the complex. The plaintiff filed a claim against the building owner arguing that it was negligent
in knowingly keeping a dangerous servant on its premises. The trial court dismissed this claim,
and the Florida Supreme Court reversed. The Court adopted Restatement of Torts § 317 which


provides that an employer may be liable for torts committed outside the scope of employment.
This is the first Florida case subjecting employers to liability for actions taken outside the scope
of employment. The Restatement provides:
A master is under a duty to exercise reasonable care so to control his servant while
acting outside the scope of his employment as to prevent him from intentionally
harming others or from so conducting himself as to create an unreasonable risk of
bodily harm to them, if
(a) the servant
(i) is upon the premises in possession of the master or upon which the servant is
privileged to enter only as his servant, or
(ii) is using a chattel of the master, and
(b) the master
(i) knows or has reason to know that he has the ability to control his servant, and
(ii) knows or should know of the necessity and opportunity for exercising such control.
Significantly for the instant case, the _Mallory_ Court did not rule that a cause of action for
negligent retention is _only_ permitted for actions covered by Restatement 317. Instead, by adopting
the Restatement, the Court created an _additional_ remedy for torts committed by an employee
outside the scope of employment. There is simply no reasonable reading of this case suggesting
that a negligent retention claim can only be brought for torts committed outside the scope of
employment. Indeed, there would be no rational justification for prohibiting a claim for negligent
retention for torts committed within the scope of employment but allowing the claim for the much
less foreseeable torts committed outside the scope of employment.
The fact that an employer may also face _respondeat superior_ liability for acts committed
within the scope of employment does not change the analysis because, as stated in the comments
to the Restatement of Agency above, the employer is also concurrently liable for its own active
negligence. Moreover, as explained below, under Florida’s comparative negligence framework,


the employer’s active negligence must be apportioned by the jury. _See Dunmore v. Eagle Motor
Lines,_ 560 So. 2d 1261 1263-64 (Fla. 1st DCA 1991) (a jury may assign comparatively greater
fault to an employer who negligently deploys a vehicle despite an unreasonable risk to other drivers
than it does solely for the employee’s negligent driving). With the elimination of joint and several
liability, each defendant is only responsible for his or her percentage of allocated fault.
Florida law continues to recognize negligent hiring, training and retention claims which do
not include a requirement that the employee’s tort be committed outside the scope of employment.
In a case with very similar facts to the instant case, a Federal Middle District Court allowed a claim
against a trucking company for negligent hiring, retaining, and supervising of a tractor-trailer
driver following a crash. _Torres v. Mikhailenko_ , 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201798 (M.D. Fla. 2012),
_adopted by Torres v. Mikhailenko_ , 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201801 (M.D. Fla. 2012). There, the
court held that to plead any of these causes of actions, plaintiff need only plead that the employer
(1) knows or should have known about the offending employee’s unfitness and (2) fails to take
appropriate action. The tractor-trailer crash was clearly within the scope of the driver’s
employment.
The Southern District of Florida has allowed claims against cruise lines to proceed under
negligent hiring and retention claims for negligence committed within the scope of employment.
_Ruben v. Silversea Cruises, Ltd.,_ 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 265616 (S.D. Fla. 2020). This case
involved an action against a cruise ship operator based on the negligence of its tour operator that
resulted in the passenger being thrown off an electric bike and injured. The action against the
cruise line for negligently hiring the tour operator was allowed to proceed. According to the court,
to state a claim for negligent hiring, the plaintiff must allege: (1) that an employee or independent
contractor was incompetent or unfit to perform the work provided; (2) that defendant knew or


reasonably should have known of the particular incompetence or unfitness; and (3) that the
incompetence or unfitness proximately caused the injuries. The court made no mention of the
scope of the employment, and, in that case, the negligence of the tour operator was certainly within
the scope of the tour operator’s employment.
Similarly, in _Gharfeh v. Carnival Corp._ , 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9621 (S.D. Fla. 2018), the
court allowed a negligent hiring and selection claim to proceed against a cruise line arising from
the negligence of an onboard doctor. The court recited the same elements of the claims for relief
as the _Ruben_ court. The alleged tort conducted by the doctor was a misdiagnosis and delay in
proper treatment which is clearly within the scope of his employment by the cruise line.
Likewise, the court in _Walsingham v. Browning_ , 525 So. 2d 996 (Fla. 1st DCA 1988),
allowed claims against an employer to proceed under negligent hiring and retention claims where
the employee’s conduct was within the scope of his employment. There, the underlying tort
involved a brawl by a nightclub security guard and a third person. In that case there was also a
separate _respondeat superior_ claim, and therefore, the conduct of the security guard must have
been within the scope of his employment. The opinion made no mention of the brawl being outside
the scope of the security guard’s employment. _See also Texas Skaggs v. Joannides_ , 372 So. 2d
985 (Fla. 2d DCA 1979) (“Florida recognizes negligent hiring, training or retention a legitimate
bases of recovery against an employer.”) In that case, the alleged tort would have been within the
scope of employment.
There are many other Florida cases reciting the elements of negligent training, retention,
and supervision claims which do not require the underlying tort to be committed outside the scope
of the employee’s employment. In _Robertson v. Duval County School Board,_ 618 So. 2d 360 (Fla.
1 st DCA 1993), the court set forth the elements of a negligent supervision claim as: (1) existence


of a duty; (2) negligent breach of the duty; and (3) proximate causation injury. _See also School
Board of Miami-Dade County v. Martinez-Oiler_ , 167 So. 3d 451 (Fla. 3d DCA 2015) (Same);
_Albra v. City of Fort Lauderdale_ , 232 Fed. Appx. 885 (11th Cir. 2007) (“To state a cause of action
for negligent supervision or negligent retention under Florida law the claimant must allege: (1) the
existences of a relationship giving rise to a legal duty to supervise; (2) negligent breach of that
duty; and (3) proximate causation injury by virtue of the breach.” _See also Atmore v. City of Lake
Wales,_ 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149596 (M.D. Fla. 2009) (same); _Viera v. City of Lake Worth_ , 2020
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 268980 (S.D. Fla. 2020) (Same) _; See also Van Etten v. School Board,_ 614 F.
Supp. 3d 1112 (N.D. Fla. 2022) _(_ “Negligent retention occurs when, during the course of
employment, the employer becomes aware or should have become aware of problems with an
employee that indicated his unfitness, and the employer fails to take further action such as
investigating, discharge, or reassignment.”) _, quoting Fernandez v. Bal Harbour Vill.,_ 49 F. Supp.
3d. 1144 (S.D. Fla. 2014); _See also Doe v. Mann,_ 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81079 (M.D. Fla. 2006)
(“To state a cause of action for negligent supervision or negligent hiring under Florida law Plaintiff
must allege (1) the existence of a relationship giving rise to a legal duty to supervise; (2) negligent
breach of that that duty; (3) proximate causation of injury by virtue of the breach.”).
One case from the Southern District of Florida has expressly rejected the view that the
employee’s conduct must be outside the scope of employment for a negligent hiring or retention
claim. _Paul v. Bradshaw,_ 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 197871 (S.D. Fla. 2013). This is a case involving
excessive force used by a police officer. In analyzing the scope of employment issue, the court
held that while Florida law _permits_ a claim for negligent hiring/retention based on conduct outside
of the scope of employment, Florida law is not limited to this circumstance and instead allows a
claim where the tortious conduct is conducted within the scope of employment. In so holding, the


Court clarified the ruling in _Garcia v. Duffy_ , 492 So. 2d 435 (Fla. 2d DCA 1986), where the court
stated “Negligent retention _allows_ for recovery against an employer for acts of an employee
committed outside the scope and course of employment.” According to _Paul_ , the _Garcia_ court did
not state that the acts of the employee must be outside the scope of employment. The _Paul_ court
also contextualized the ruling in _Watson v. Hialeah,_ 552 So. 2d 1146 (Fla. 3d DCA 1989), stating
that case did not rest on whether the tort was committed within the scope of the employment, but
rather was decided against the plaintiff because plaintiff failed to prove proximate causation. The
_Paul_ court concluded by holding “plaintiff here is not barred from pleading a negligent hiring and
retention claim under Florida law merely because she did not assert that Woodside was not acting
within the scope of the employment at the time of the arrest.”
Similarly, in _Thomas v. Indian River City Sheriff’s Dep’t,_ 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 191110
(S.D. Fla. 2021), the Southern District again stated that a negligent hiring or supervision claim can
be brought for torts committed within the scope of an employee’s employment. This was another
claim for excessive force by a police officer. In a lengthy footnote, the court analyzed Florida law
and found that while Florida permits an action for negligent hiring for torts committed outside the
scope of employment, Florida law does not require the torts to be committed outside the scope of
employment. Accordingly, the court found that a cause of action could be pled against the City
for negligent hiring/supervision where the officer’s tortious conduct occurred during the scope of
his employment as an officer. _See also Green v. R.J. Behar & Co.,_ 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44304
(S.D. Fla. 2010) (“Florida law is not all that clear that ‘outside the scope of employment’ is a
necessary element of negligent hiring, retention.”).
In conclusion, Plaintiff has stated claims for relief against NATS for the negligent training,
monitoring and supervision of MR. DACOSTA arising out of the negligent driving committed by


MR. DACOSTA in the course of his employment. The authority for these claims is the
Restatement of Agency (Second) 2d § 213, which has been adopted in Florida. Moreover, when
the Florida Supreme Court decided to allow claims to be brought against employers for torts
committed outside the scope of employment under Restatement of Torts 317, it created an
additional theory of liability; it did not do away with the common law claims for negligent hiring
and retention. Florida has continuously allowed claims to proceed for negligent training and
supervision based on an employee’s torts committed within the scope of employment.
**IV. Cases Defendant NATS relies on to support its contention to eliminate an
active negligence cause of action, such as: Clooney v. Geeting, 352 So.2d 1216
(Fla. 2d DCA 1977) are not binding or persuasive.**
Defendant NATS erroneously argues the 40 plus-year-old, _Clooney v. Geeting_ , 352 So.2d
1216 (Fla. 2d DCA 1977) decision which is neither binding nor persuasive.
The Second District Court of Appeals decided _Clooney_ nearly 40 years ago.^11 When
_Clooney_ was decided, Florida had joint and several liability, and, as a result of the subsequent
elimination of joint and several liability, the underpinnings of the _Clooney_ rational no longer exist.
Consequently, Florida state trial courts—including trial courts in Miami-Dade County ( _See_ Order
dated August 22, 2024, attached to Exhibit “A”)—routinely reject _Clooney_ and deny motions to
dismiss direct negligence claims based on an admission of vicarious liability.^12 Defendant’s

Just two years after _Clooney_ , the First District Court of Appeals rejected _Clooney_ :
_Clooney v. Geeting_ ... held that where separately stated theories in
counts of a complaint allege no addiaccident case, a trial court should notional liability int allow them to be presented to a motor vehicle
the jury since the desirability of allowing such separate theories in
the absence of additional liability was outweighed by potential
prejudice to the defendants. Count III [for negligent hiring] alleged
not only a different theory than that stated in Counts I and II [negligent operation and vicarious liability] but was also one which,
if proved, imposed additional liability upon a defendant not named
in either counts one and two.... Moreover, _both the agent and the
principal are subject to suit for their own respective negligence_.
_Petrik v. N.H. Ins. Co.,_ 379 So. 2d 1287, 1290–91 (Fla 1st DCA 1979) (internal citations omitted
and emphasis added).
Eleven years later, the First and Fifth District Court of Appeals again rejected _Clooney_ in
_Dunmore v. Eagle Motor Lines_ and _Trevino v. Mobley,_ discussed at length in Paragraph II, above.
Comparative fault is now the law of the land in Florida. Clooney was decided shortly after
Florida changed its common law rule from contributory negligence to comparative negligence.
Unlike Clooney, where the injured plaintiff’s comparative negligence was not an issue, NATS
explicitly alleges that ROBERT ADAMS, JR.’s negligence was a contributing factor to the crash.
In _Hoffman v. Jones_ , the Florida Supreme Court took the first step in equating liability with fault,
explaining that “[i]f fault is to remain the test of liability, then the doctrine of comparative
negligence which involves apportionment of the loss among those who contributed to the
occurrence is more consistent with liability based on a fault premise.” The Court reasoned that
“[w]hen the negligence of more than one person contributes to the occurrence of an accident, each
should pay the proportion of the total damages he has caused to the other party.”
The Florida legislature supplemented _Hoffman_ in 1986 (nine years after Clooney was
decided) when it abolished joint and several liability. FLA. STAT. ANN. §768.81. Section 768.81
“squarely directed that any judgment against a defendant be based on the defendant’s percentage


of fault in causing any damage and not on joint and several liability.” Shortly after the legislature
enacted Section 768.81, the Florida Supreme Court held that “the only means of determining a
party’s percentage of fault is to compare that party’s percentage to all of the other entities who
contributed to the accident.”
In adopting comparative negligence and eliminating joint and several liability, the Florida
Supreme Court and legislature established that fault must be apportioned between all potentially
negligent parties whose negligence may have caused or contributed to a plaintiff’s injuries. It
follows that the jury must consider evidence of all negligence that substantially contributed to a
collision, particularly where, as here, Defendants have asserted that ROBERT ADAMS, JR. was
negligent. This would defeat the fundamental principles of Florida’s negligence laws that require
apportioning fault among all negligent parties. A jury could rationally conclude that NATS, who
is in a distinctly superior position to know and recognize the relevant hazards and who chose to
place an ill-trained, unsupervised driver on an overloaded route with delivery deadlines, is far more
blameworthy than the truck driver himself. This could reduce the percentage of fault assessed
against MR. DACOSTA and affect the jury’s apportionment of fault against Plaintiff.
“Florida’s system of comparative negligence was implemented for the express purpose of
allowing recovery in negligence cases based on a jury’s allocation of comparative fault—on a
percentage basis—among all individuals who were negligent in bringing about an injury.”
Clooney is not binding or persuasive. Florida courts and courts across the country refuse to follow
it. In any event, unlike Clooney, Defendant NATS alleges comparative fault against the injured
plaintiff. There is no basis to eliminate a cause of action against a trucking company like NATS
that failed to exercise reasonable care, putting a dangerous driver at the wheel of a tractor-trailer
that caused catastrophic injuries and the death of ROBERT ADAMS, JR.


Further, _Clooney_ addressed an evidentiary issue, specifically the admissibility of a bad
driving record at trial. As a post-trial evidentiary opinion, it is entirely inapplicable on a motion
to dismiss or strike at trial.^14 In _Capodanno v. Premier Transp. &Warehousing, Inc._ , a court
interpreting Florida law denied a trucking company’s motion for judgment on the pleadings based
on _Clooney_.^15 In _Capodanno_ , plaintiff, who was injured in a motor vehicle accident involving a
tractor-trailer, alleged that the owner of the tractor-trailer was negligent in hiring, supervising, and
training the driver of the truck.^16 In its motion for judgment on the pleadings, the defendant truck
owner argued that, under _Clooney_ , the plaintiff was not entitled to recover damages on these active
negligence claims because the employer had “admitted liability agency for its driver.”^17 The
_Capodanno_ court disagreed, holding that _Clooney_ “address[es] the type of evidence that a jury
should be allowed to hear. At this point in the proceeding, the Court is not ruling on evidentiary
matters. Nor is a judgment on the pleadings an appropriate device to obtain such a ruling. Thus,
[the employer-truck owner] has made no compelling argument that it is entitled to judgment on

Plaintiff submits NATS’s negligent acts “are just the type of evidence that a jury should be
allowed to hear” when apportioning comparative fault among the parties.
As set forth above, the _Clooney_ decision is not good law, solely addresses an evidentiary
issue, and should not be used to eliminate a cause of action against a trucking company like NATS
that negligently hired and retained a dangerous truck driver like MR. DACOSTA.
**CONCLUSION**
Defendant NATS’s motion should be denied as the law and equity both require that any
direct negligence of NATS be considered by the jury so that all parties’ fault can be assessed,
compared and brought to bear by the jury’s verdict. Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion should be
denied.
**WHEREFORE** , Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court deny
Defendant’s Motion for Partial Judgment on the Pleadings and allow Plaintiff to move forward on
Count II of Plaintiff’s Complaint.
