## Technical Architecture

### Recent Architecture Updates (December 2024)

#### Source Document Discovery System
The exhibit tracking system has been completely replaced with a source document discovery system that better aligns with legal practice:

1. **Document Classification Pipeline**
   - Automatic classification into document types (deposition, medical record, etc.)
   - AI-powered metadata extraction (parties, dates, key facts)
   - Relevance tagging for legal arguments (liability, damages, causation)

2. **Evidence Discovery Agent**
   - Semantic search for documents supporting specific arguments
   - AI-powered exhibit suggestions with purpose statements
   - Evidence strategy generation showing document relationships

3. **Key Improvements**
   - Exhibits are no longer tracked (they're motion-specific labels)
   - Source documents are indexed for discovery and reuse
   - AI helps find and organize evidence for each motion
