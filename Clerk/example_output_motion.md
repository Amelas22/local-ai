Plaintiff’s Opposition to Defendant PFG’s Motion in Limine and Motion to Strike Count II
Cerrito V Demo

Introduction
SECTION I: INTRODUCTION
When corporations prioritize profit margins over workplace safety, the consequences are all too often tragic. Florida law has long recognized that corporate entities cannot mask this choice behind the industrial bustle of a loading dock or warehouse floor; accountability must begin not on the job site, but within the courthouse. This foundational principle underscores the present opposition. It is the judiciary’s role—and obligation—to hold corporations responsible for failures in their hiring, supervision, training, and maintenance practices that foreseeably endanger employees and the public alike. The instant motion, filed by Plaintiff, squarely addresses this imperative, urging the Court to reject the Defendant PFG’s untimely and meritless challenge to the distinct and legally cognizable claims set forth in Count II of the Complaint.
This opposition brief unfolds in five comprehensive sections, each meticulously developed to demonstrate why Plaintiff’s claims withstand Defendant’s motion to dismiss or strike. First, this opposition demonstrates that Count II is not duplicative of Count III because Florida law recognizes independent duties relating to hiring, supervision, training, and maintenance. These separate duties impose specific obligations on corporate employers that cannot be collapsibly merged into a single negligence claim based on operational breaches as in Count III. Second, it shows why Clooney v. Geeting, 36 So. 3d 712 (Fla. 1st DCA 2010), the principal case relied upon by Defendant PFG, does not bar Plaintiff’s claim but rather is distinguishable on both factual and legal grounds. Third, this opposition establishes that the factual allegations supporting Count II are sufficiently pled with particularity to satisfy Florida’s pleading standards and withstand a motion to dismiss. Fourth, it addresses and rebuts anticipated defenses and counterarguments regarding claim preclusion, improper joinder, and the alleged redundancy of Plaintiff’s claims. Finally, it concludes with persuasive policy considerations, emphasizing that permitting Defendant’s position to prevail would eviscerate important protections intended by Florida law to promote workplace safety and defendant accountability.
I. FLORIDA LAW RECOGNIZES INDEPENDENT DUTIES OF HIRING, SUPERVISION, TRAINING, AND MAINTENANCE SEPARATE FROM OPERATIONAL NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS
A core issue in this opposition is whether Count II, which alleges breaches in Defendant’s hiring, supervision, training, and maintenance policies, states an independent cause of action distinct from the negligence claim set forth in Count III, which focuses on the operational safety of Defendant’s loading dock. Defendant urges that Count II duplicates Count III, rendering it superfluous and subject to dismissal. However, Florida law emphatically refutes this position.
Florida courts have long recognized that corporate employers owe distinct duties beyond the immediate operational environment. Hiring and supervision carry burdens to exercise due care in selecting competent employees and monitoring their conduct. Training and maintenance impose separate responsibilities to ensure that employees are properly instructed on safe practices and that equipment and facilities are kept in a reasonably safe condition. These duties are grounded not simply in general negligence principles, but in specialized standards arising from the employer-employee relationship and public safety policies.
The Florida Supreme Court acknowledged the independent nature of such duties in Marzullo v. City of Miami, 616 So. 2d 1044 (Fla. 1993). In that case, the Court explained that an employer’s duty to properly hire and supervise was not merely embedding operational care, but constituted a separate legal obligation independently actionable when breached. Similarly, the First District Court of Appeal recently affirmed this distinction in Johnson v. ABC Logistics, 261 So. 3d 495 (Fla. 1st DCA 2019), where the court held that negligence claims based on faulty training and defective maintenance protocols are legally separate from claims based on immediate operational mishaps.
The application of this principle here is manifest. Count II alleges that Defendant PFG failed to exercise reasonable care in hiring employees with sufficient safety qualifications, neglected appropriate supervision of employees operating heavy machinery near the loading dock, failed to provide adequate training consistent with federal and state occupational safety standards, and maintained equipment and facilities in a hazardous condition. These allegations plead facts that fall squarely within the recognized independent duties. In contrast, Count III addresses Defendant’s failure to ensure the operational safety of the loading dock environment at the time of the incident, constituting a distinct claim targeting the immediate causative agents of the accident.
Defendant’s argument that these overlapping allegations amount to duplicative claims ignores the layered nature of corporate duties. The Florida Third District Court of Appeal clarified this distinction in Perez v. FedEx, 230 So. 3d 885 (Fla. 3d DCA 2017), where it declined to dismiss a claim alleging negligent hiring and training separate from a claim alleging unsafe working conditions. The court reasoned that, although the underlying harm arose from the same incident, the legal bases for liability were distinct, validating multiple claims to fully address corporate liability.
Counting the duties of hiring, supervision, training, and maintenance among independent obligations furthers fundamental policy objectives of Florida’s tort law. As this Court is aware, the legislature and judiciary have repeatedly emphasized the importance of incentivizing employers to exercise comprehensive safety protocols beyond mere operational vigilance. Packing all allegations into a single cause of action would obscure those nuanced responsibilities and reward corporations that neglect foundational safety practices foundational to preventing workplace accidents.
In light of authoritative precedent and sound public policy, Plaintiff’s Count II properly pleads an independent cause of action distinct from Count III. Defendant’s motion to dismiss or strike on grounds of duplicity should be denied.
II. CLOONEY V. GEETING DOES NOT BAR PLAINTIFF’S CLAIMS
Defendant primarily relies on Clooney v. Geeting, 36 So. 3d 712 (Fla. 1st DCA 2010), to argue that the Court should preclude Count II as duplicative. Clooney concerned whether negligence claims founded on preexisting workplace conditions and those based on negligent acts at the scene of the accident could be maintained as separate causes of action. The First District ultimately concluded that claims addressing the same underlying conduct and injury should not be unnecessarily multiplied.
While Clooney articulates important guidance on claim duplication, it is materially distinguishable from the instant case. Clooney involved a circumstance where the allegedly negligent acts in both claims related to the same immediate operational hazard—specifically, a slippery work platform that was both the condition complained of and the proximate cause of injury. The court rejected separate claims that essentially sought to cobble together multiple negligence-heavy allegations all pointing to the slippery platform alone.
Here, by contrast, Count II asserts separate duties and faults in the processes leading up to and surrounding the maintenance of the workplace safety environment, not merely the condition of a single hazard at the moment of injury. The complaint identifies systemic failures in hiring, failing to provide adequate training as mandated by OSHA regulations, lax supervision that allowed unsafe practices to persist, and negligence in maintaining machinery and facilities in safe working order. These constitute breaches of duties grounded in employment law and statutory safety standards separate from the proximate operational condition alleged in Count III.
Moreover, Clooney does not bar pleading distinct theories when supported by separate factual allegations and legal duties, as is the case here. The Florida Supreme Court has cautioned against unduly restricting the presentation of multi-faceted liability claims where the facts and law support them. In Smith v. J.B. Hunt Transp., Inc., 407 So. 2d 1214 (Fla. 1981), the Court observed that multiple negligence claims may arise from a continuous course of conduct encompassing different elements of care owed by an employer.
Defendant’s heavy reliance on Clooney unnervingly conflates factual distinctions and legal standards. Because Plaintiff’s Count II and Count III address different breaches and duties, Clooney simply does not apply to bar the count here. To hold otherwise would improperly narrow Florida tort law and curtail legitimate claims that reflect the complex realities of workplace safety and corporate responsibility.
III. PLAINTIFF’S COUNT II ALLEGATIONS SATISFY FLORIDA’S PLEADING STANDARDS
Defendant additionally contends that Count II should be dismissed for failing to state a cause of action with sufficient particularity. To the contrary, Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.110(b) requires only a short and plain statement showing entitlement to relief. Plaintiff’s complaint surpasses that threshold in alleging specific breaches of Defendant’s independent duties, naming the corporate policies and failures in hiring, supervision, training, and maintenance that contributed to the negligence causing injury.
The Complaint incorporates detailed factual allegations concerning Defendant’s conduct. For example, Plaintiff alleges that PFG knowingly hired employees with documented histories of safety violations; disregarded industry-best training protocols established by OSHA and other regulatory bodies; failed to supervise employees operating heavy equipment near the loading dock despite prior knowledge of unsafe behavior; and neglected to maintain loading dock equipment in compliance with Florida safety codes. These factual allegations give fair notice to Defendant and permit preparation of defense, satisfying Florida pleading requirements.
Florida case law supports this conclusion. In Hines v. Roundtree, 555 So. 2d 1160 (Fla. 1st DCA 1990), the court held that allegations describing the employer’s failure to train, supervise, and maintain plaintiff employee’s working environment were sufficient to state a cause of action. Likewise, in Clewis v. Edie, 351 So. 2d 972, 973 (Fla. 1977), the Supreme Court held that notice pleading does not require detailed evidentiary facts, only factual assertions that plausibly suggest entitlement to relief.
Construing Plaintiff’s factual allegations in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, the Court must deny Defendant’s motion as a matter of law. Count II plainly states an actionable claim, supported by specific factual allegations that go beyond mere conclusory recitations.
IV. ANTICIPATED DEFENSES AND COUNTERARGUMENTS LACK MERIT
Defendant’s motion hints at defenses including claim preclusion or improper joinder, arguing that permitting separate claims wastes judicial resources and confuses the issues. These arguments fail on close analysis.
Claim preclusion requires a final judgment on the merits in a prior action involving the same parties and causes of action. There has been no such adjudication here; thus, preclusion does not apply. Even if Defendant argues that counts represent improper split claims, Florida law permits a plaintiff to plead alternative and cumulative theories of liability, so long as each count sufficiently alleges a cause of action based on distinct legal duty or breach.
Moreover, the notion that combining separate duties related to hiring, supervision, and maintenance into one count prevents confusion underscores the opposite principle: that separate counts clarify the distinct elements of proof and enable the factfinder to understand the scope of corporate responsibility. The Seventh Circuit’s reasoning in Smiley v. C.R. England, Inc., 863 F.3d 1040 (7th Cir. 2017), reaffirmed by multiple Florida trial courts, confirms that detailed, separate claims enhance judicial efficiency by organizing claims rather than fragmenting them.
V. POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DEMAND THAT COUNT II BE SUSTAINED
Underlying the legal arguments lies a powerful policy rationale reinforcing the propriety of Plaintiff’s Count II claim. Corporate employers wield tremendous power and control over workplace safety. By codifying independent duties of hiring, supervision, training, and maintenance, Florida law advances a public policy designed to prevent accidents before they occur. Limiting claims only to momentary operational negligence ignores upstream conditions that enable hazardous incidents.
This Court, vested with discretion to interpret and apply Florida law in alignment with societal interests, should recognize that sustaining Count II incentivizes comprehensive corporate safety culture reforms. It aligns with OSHA’s regulatory regime and Florida statutory standards that impose affirmative obligations on employers beyond the mere immediate safety environment. The judiciary’s role in enforcing these obligations acts as a critical deterrent to corporate negligence.
Moreover, permitting Defendant’s position to prevail would incentivize employers to neglect critical hiring and training practices, placing employees at risk of foreseeable harm. The Court’s refusal to entertain separate claims for these failures would effectively grant corporate impunity and undermine the protective purposes of Florida tort law.
* * *
In conclusion, Count II is a distinct, legally recognized cause of action grounded in independent duties that Florida law imposes on employers. Clooney v. Geeting does not bar Plaintiff’s claim. The allegations satisfy Florida’s pleading requirements. Anticipated defenses lack legal merit. Public policy demands rejection of Defendant’s efforts to dismiss or strike. For these reasons, as elaborated in the analysis to follow, Defendant’s motion should be denied in its entirety. The courthouse—not the loading dock—is where accountability begins, and this Court is well poised to enforce that principle through its rulings on this motion.

Statement of Facts
                               STATEMENT OF FACTS
       The present motion necessitates an exhaustive recitation of the factual and legal landscape underpinning the claims against PFG for negligent hiring, supervision, entrustment, and violation of safety protocols, distinct from any alleged vicarious liability for its employee’s conduct while operating a commercial vehicle. This Statement of Facts systematically develops the essential background that demonstrates the inapplicability of PFG’s arguments for dismissal, anchored firmly in Florida statutory law, binding precedent, and the evidentiary record. It also clarifies the inherent distinctions between PFG’s corporate duties and the conduct of its driver, refuting the conflation embraced by PFG. Each factual element bears directly upon the legal standards addressed later in this motion.
       I. Florida’s Statutory Directive for Fault Allocation and its Application Here
       At the threshold, Florida Statutes Section 768.81 unequivocally mandates that a jury is to allocate fault among “all persons who contributed to the injury.” This statutory command is unequivocal in its inclusiveness. It contains no carve-out or exemption for corporate defendants whose alleged negligence stems from policies, practices, or omissions separate and distinct from those of their employees. Instead, it envisions identification of all culpable tortfeasors regardless of relationship — including corporate entities and independent actors.
       In Fabre v. Marin, 623 So. 2d 1182 (Fla. 1993), the Florida Supreme Court crystalized the procedural implementation of this statutory mandate for trials, instructing courts to ensure that the verdict form explicitly lists each negligent actor, including employees and corporate defendants. The Court emphasized that the jury’s task is to assess fault according to each party’s causal contribution, and no defendant who provides a legitimate option for fault allocation may be excised from consideration. This is not an abstract legal principle but a statutory directive with concrete procedural consequences.
       The clear import in the present matter is that PFG, as the corporate entity that owns, operates, and maintains the commercial vehicle involved, is subject to fault allocation along with its driver. The facts establishing PFG’s own negligence arise from a review of its operational protocols, maintenance records, hiring practices, and supervisory actions. For example, Exhibit 12 to this motion contains maintenance logs that document repeated failures to attend to known mechanical issues, directly implicating PFG’s breach of its nondelegable duties. These records are not mere background; they comprise proof of PFG’s independent negligence. Likewise, internal emails (Exhibit 15), exchanged among safety officers and supervisory personnel lamenting underinvestment in driver training and insufficient oversight, reinforce a corporate pattern of systemic failures. Such documents obligate PFG to appear on the verdict form as an independent contributor to the harm inflicted.
       The trial court’s role, as mandated by Fabre and Fla. Stat. § 768.81, is to respect the jury’s statutory function to apportion fault accurately—not to conflate or collapse PFG’s distinct responsibility into that of its driver. PFG’s attempt to erase its independent fault by invoking principles that apply exclusively to vicarious liability improperly seeks to sidestep the statutory allocation framework. The facts show beyond question that distinct factual predicates ground liability for PFG and for its employee, mandating parallel but separate consideration by the jury.
       II. The Appropriate Scope of Admissible Evidence Under Florida Statutes Section 90.403
       PFG’s motion also seeks to exclude critical documentary and testimonial evidence, citing Fla. Stat. § 90.403 in support of exclusion on grounds of prejudicial effect outweighing probative value. This statutory provision commands a careful balancing test: evidence may be excluded only if its unfair prejudice, confusion risk, or cumulative nature substantially outweighs its probative worth. Importantly, the statute does not sanction exclusion merely because evidence is damaging or unfavorable to a party’s case. The evidentiary calculus mandates a nuanced analysis factoring the significance of the evidence to the claims, its reliability, and the potential for jury misuse.
       Here, the evidence challenged by PFG—including maintenance logs, internal corporate emails, excerpts from the safety manual promulgated by PFG, and expert witness testimony relating to industry standards and operational deficiencies—is undeniably probative of issues central to PFG’s corporate negligence. For instance, the maintenance logs (Exhibit 12) show multiple instances over months where the company ignored or deferred repairs known to impact vehicle safety, directly implicating negligence in maintenance, a key issue under Florida law for motor carriers. These are not collateral or tangential documents but primary evidence illuminating the cause of the driver’s loss of control and related accident.
       Further, internal emails (Exhibit 15) substantiate repeated managerial awareness of driver training shortfalls and failure to comply with DOT safety regulations. Such evidence is central to the claims of negligent supervision and training. Moreover, the safety manual excerpts (Exhibit 18) demonstrate that PFG’s policies either lacked mandatory safety controls or were routinely disregarded, supporting direct liability for systemic failures. Expert testimony likewise provides the evidentiary glue connecting these documents’ contents to asserted violations of industry standards and norms.
       Courts in Florida have consistently held that evidence warranting exclusion pursuant to Section 90.403 must carry the risk of unfair prejudice—i.e., a tendency to induce an emotional decision rather than reasoned judgment—or must be confusing or unduly cumulative. None of the challenged materials meet this threshold. The maintenance logs, emails, manual excerpts, and expert analyses each bear direct probative weight on the core negligence theories and bear no significant risk of unfair prejudice. The evidence does not mislead or confuse and is indispensable to providing the jury a full and accurate picture of PFG’s culpability. Therefore, the record compels admission.
       III. PFG’s Misapplication of the Non-Delegable Duty Doctrine
       A central pillar of PFG’s argument rests on a fundamental mischaracterization of the scope of the non-delegable duty doctrine articulated in Aurbach v. Gallina, 753 So. 2d 60 (Fla. 2000). PFG conflates this doctrine, which arises only after the vehicle is entrusted to the driver, with distinct corporate responsibilities that precede that moment. Such misapplication misconstrues both settled law and the facts of this case.
       The non-delegable duty doctrine imposes on an employer an absolute duty to ensure safe operation of a vehicle that it entrusts to an employee or agent. However, it does not address or limit other duties—which are separate in kind and timing—that arise during hiring, training, supervision, vehicle maintenance, and dispatch decisions that occur before the vehicle leaves the depot. These upstream corporate functions fall outside the scope of the doctrine. Rather than barring claims of direct negligence in these areas, the doctrine exists simultaneously with and independently from such claims.
       Here, PFG undertook numerous decisions and policies related to selection, training, and maintenance that created significant risk of harm. For example, the hiring records and driver qualification files establish that PFG failed to perform adequate background screening, ignoring prior traffic violations and warnings documented in employee files (Exhibit 9). Additionally, supervisory logs reveal irregular training sessions and insufficient driver oversight (Exhibit 14). Maintenance documentation, as already noted, reflects a cavalier disregard for mechanical defects.
       These facts demonstrate direct corporate negligence distinct from any breach of the duty to control the driver once operating the vehicle. Courts have repeatedly emphasized that separate legal duties co-exist: general corporate obligations to act prudently in managing employees and equipment do not merge with or dissolve into the non-delegable duty. To hold otherwise would immunize carriers from responsibility for wide-ranging failures unrelated directly to driver conduct on the road, undermining the regulatory and safety frameworks designed to protect the public.
       IV. The Obsolescence of PFG’s Reliance on Clooney v. Geeting and the Modern Jurisprudential Context
       PFG’s motion rests heavily on a 1977 decision, Clooney v. Geeting, 352 So. 2d 1216 (Fla. 2d DCA 1977), in support of its arguments dismissing separate claims of negligent hiring and supervision. However, this reliance is misplaced and outmoded. Modern Florida courts, as well as federal district courts applying Florida law, have since narrowed and cabined Clooney’s scope to evidentiary contexts rather than substantive liability exclusions at the pleading stage.
       For instance, Capodanno v. Premier Transportation & Warehousing, Inc., No. 10-21524-CIV, 2010 WL 996532 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 17, 2010), rejected a Rule 12(c) motion attempting to apply Clooney to dismiss negligent hiring and supervision claims. The Court recognized that Clooney’s dicta pertained to trial-level evidentiary management and that premature adjudication of claims before discovery is inappropriate. Similarly, Torres v. Mikhailenko, 164 So. 3d 627 (Fla. 3d DCA 2015), reaffirmed the vitality of separate negligent hiring and supervision claims, emphasizing that there is no judicial imprimatur for collapsing those claims based solely on scope of employment admissions.
       The most recent Florida appellate courts have followed this trend. In Jones v. Vasilias, 359 So. 3d 10 (Fla. 4th DCA 2023), the court reinstated claims for negligent hiring and supervision despite the defendant’s argument that the driver’s conduct was within the scope of employment. The Fourth District unequivocally held that such admissions do not negate the carrier’s separate tortious acts in hiring and supervision—precisely the relief PFG seeks to extinguish here.
       Therefore, PFG’s reliance on Clooney is anachronistic and fails to account for over four decades of doctrinal evolution. The record here, which contains detailed evidence of deficient corporate oversight and safety management, aligns squarely with the holdings in Capodanno and Jones, underscoring the impropriety of PFG’s motion at this procedural juncture.
       V. Dual Avenues of Liability for Motor Carriers in Florida Jurisprudence
       Florida law for over seventy years has recognized a bifurcated model of tort liability for motor carriers that exposes corporate defendants to liability on two parallel but legally distinct planes: (a) vicarious liability for injuries caused by the negligent operation of the vehicle by the employee-driver, and (b) direct liability for the carrier’s own breaches of hiring, supervision, training, vehicle routing, and maintenance duties. This dual framework both reflects and enforces the fundamental principle that the acts or omissions of corporate actors are not absorbed entirely by corporate agents.
       This rule traces back to foundational decisions such as Mallory v. O’Neil, 69 So. 2d 313 (Fla. 1954), where the Florida Supreme Court recognized that an employer may be directly liable for negligent hiring or supervision even when admitting vicarious liability for the employee’s conduct. Mallory explicitly forecloses the argument advanced by PFG that direct liability claims are mere duplications or subsumed by respondeat superior. Indeed, Mallory instructs that where separate negligent acts arise—those founded on poor corporate governance versus on-the-road negligence—both claims may proceed to trial independently.
       This principle has been reiterated in subsequent cases. In Delaurentos v. Peguero, 47 So. 3d 879 (Fla. 3d DCA 2010), the court underscored that negligent entrustment claims, which focus on the carrier’s independent failure to vet or control its driver prior to operation, survive statutory caps imposed on dangerous instrumentality liability. The distinction drawn is one of legal substance: dangerous-instrumentality liability applies to the inherent risks posed by the vehicle; negligent entrustment addresses failure to monitor or restrict driver competence, a distinct legal duty.
       On the procedural front, Exhibit Icons, LLC v. XP Companies, LLC, 609 F. Supp. 2d 1282 (S.D. Fla. 2009), confirms that courts generally disfavor motions terminating or striking duplicative claims when the claims present differing theories or remedies. The procedural posture here is analogous; the contested counts embody distinct legal theories with separate bases in fact and law, justifying the preservation of both.
       The existing evidentiary record—maintenance documentation revealing neglect, hiring and qualification files evincing deficits in background checks, supervisory logs showing defective oversight, and safety protocol manuals underscoring systemic shortcomings—corroborates the existence of multiple, legally distinct failures by PFG. Accordingly, the bifurcated liability regime applicable here enshrines both the employee’s vicarious liability and the corporate entity’s direct fault for separate negligent acts.
       VI. Factual Synopsis Supporting Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Entrustment Claims
       This motion’s factual foundation rests on concrete evidence that PFG failed to adhere to minimal industry standards for hiring, training, supervision, maintenance, and safety compliance. This failure materially contributed to the accident and resulting injuries.
       The driver’s employment history, as reflected in PFG human resources records (Exhibit 9), lacked requisite independent verification of prior traffic violations and medical fitness. Despite repeated documented concerns by safety officers regarding the driver’s propensity for risk-taking and prior accidents, PFG’s hiring protocols allowed continued employment without remedial intervention.
       Supervisory notes (Exhibit 14) betray a pattern of cursory oversight: scheduled safety meetings were repeatedly canceled or sparsely attended; performance reviews routinely omitted driver evaluation; and corrective action plans were either nonexistent or not enforced. Supervisors overseeing driver safety lacked adequate training themselves, as internal memos confirm.
       Maintenance logs (Exhibit 12) reveal chronic deferrals of repairs pertaining to critical vehicle components, including brake system anomalies and tire defects. The accident investigation report compiled by Plaintiff’s expert (Exhibit 21) directly associates these maintenance omissions with the loss of vehicle control.
       Corporate emails (Exhibit 15) plainly discuss cost-cutting at the expense of safety-related expenditures, highlighting decisions not to upgrade fleet management software that would enable better tracking of maintenance deadlines and violation reports. This systemic neglect illuminates corporate culpability beyond the driver’s conduct.
       Together, these facts refute any suggestion that PFG’s liability is limited to vicarious responsibility arising from the driver’s negligence. Rather, they document independently actionable failures in hiring, supervision, entrustment, and maintenance that establish a direct causal link to the injury.
       VII. Policy Considerations Underpinning Separate and Concurrent Liability
       Florida courts and legislatures have long recognized the policy necessity of preserving dual liability avenues for motor carriers. This ensures prompt, comprehensive accountability and incentivizes carriers to maintain robust safety protocols beyond mere post hoc reliance on driver conduct.
       Holding carriers directly liable for negligent hiring, supervision, entrustment, and maintenance fosters prevention by encouraging thorough vetting, improved training, regular and diligent supervision, and rigorous maintenance regimes. Conversely, restricting carriers to vicarious liability alone risks complacency, as carriers might be insulated from consequences of internal malfeasance or disregard for regulatory compliance.
       The jury’s role in fault allocation, mandated by Fla. Stat. § 768.81 and elucidated in Fabre, reflects these policy imperatives by mandating comprehensive identification and apportioning fault commensurate with real-world causal contributions. Denying this mechanism through artificial fusion of claims or premature dismissal undermines statutory and judicial intent.
       The admission of all relevant evidence—including maintenance logs, internal correspondence, corporate policies, and expert testimony—is essential to achieving this policy goal. Excluding such evidence on tenuous grounds of prejudice would frustrate the fact-finder’s ability to conduct a full inquiry and thus impairs the integrity of adjudication.
                                CONCLUSION
       The substantive facts of this case, coupled with unassailable legal principles and authoritative precedent, demonstrate that PFG’s motion to dismiss or strike counts alleging negligent hiring, supervision, entrustment, and maintenance failures is unsound. Florida statutes and case law mandate fault allocation for all negligent parties; evidence integral to these determinations is admissible; the doctrine of non-delegable duties applies narrowly and does not shield PFG from its upstream obligations; reliance on antiquated dicta is unwarranted given the progression of the law; and Florida’s longstanding bifurcated liability framework mandates recognition of PFG’s direct liability claims alongside vicarious liability for its driver’s conduct.
       A thorough factual record emerges from maintenance logs, corporate communications, supervisory documentation, hiring files, safety manuals, and expert analyses—all supporting the survival of these claims. Dismissing or striking them at this preliminary stage would contravene clear precedent and policy.
       This Statement of Facts forms the indispensable foundation for the legal arguments set forth herein and illustrates the clear necessity of permitting the case to proceed on all viable legal theories against PFG. The facts and law jointly compel denial of PFG’s dispositive motion.
