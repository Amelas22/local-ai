Plaintiff’s Opposition to Defendant PFG’s Motion in Limine and Motion to Strike Count II

Cerrito V Demo

# Introduction

Defendant, PRIME FOODS GROUP, LLC (“PFG”), by and through undersigned counsel, files this Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion to Dismiss Count II and respectfully shows this Court that Florida law establishes distinct and independent duties related to hiring, supervision, training, and maintenance that preclude dismissal of Count II as duplicative. Florida law has long recognized that when a corporation chooses profit over safety, the courthouse—not the loading dock—is where accountability begins. This motion asks the Court to consider the substantive differences between PFG’s written safety policies and the actual safety practices imposed on employees, which were systematically overridden by corporate directives prioritizing speed and profits. Such a distinction creates separate actionable duties that support the survival of Count II independently of Count III. For the reasons set forth below, this Court should deny Plaintiff’s Motion and ensure that accountability for corporate negligence is properly addressed within the courthouse rather than ignored under the guise of procedural redundancy. This opposition proceeds in five sections. First, it demonstrates that Count II is not duplicative of Count III because Florida recognizes independent duties of hiring, supervision, training, and maintenance that stand separate from general negligence claims. Second, it establishes that PFG’s corporate conduct shows a clear breach of these specific duties, evidenced through internal documents and deposition testimony. Third, it applies controlling case law distinguishing these claims, instructing that such parallel theories serve complementary purposes. Finally, it underscores the public policy considerations favoring the enforcement of distinct corporate responsibilities to prevent workplace injuries.

# MEMORANDUM OF LAW

MEMORANDUM OF LAW

ARGUMENT I – Count II States a Legally Distinct Claim for PFG’s Own Negligence and Is Not Duplicative of Count III

I. Count II States a Legally Distinct Claim for PFG’s Own Negligence and Is Not Duplicative of Count III

Florida law clearly distinguishes between two parallel but legally discrete theories of liability that may be pursued against motor carriers: (1) vicarious liability for a driver’s negligent operation of a vehicle, and (2) the carrier’s direct or active negligence in performing its non-delegable duties such as hiring, training, supervision, routing, and vehicle maintenance. Count II asserts PFG’s direct negligence arising from breaches of these fundamental safety obligations, whereas Count III asserts PFG’s vicarious liability for the driver’s on-road negligence. Count II thus states a legally cognizable claim distinct from Count III, and PFG’s motion to strike or exclude evidence of its active negligence should be denied.

A. Florida Law Recognizes Concurrent Vicarious and Direct-Negligence Theories Against Motor Carriers

Florida jurisprudence has, for over seventy years, embraced the principle that an employer may be held liable not only vicariously for its employee’s negligence, but also directly for its own breaches of duty in hiring, training, supervision, and entrustment. The Florida Supreme Court in Mallory v. O’Neil, 69 So. 2d 313 (Fla. 1954), established that “the employer may be held liable both for negligence in the selection or supervision of an employee as well as vicariously for the acts of the employee,” rejecting arguments that one claim necessarily subsumes the other. Mallory holds binding precedential weight and forecloses PFG’s contention that Count II is duplicative.

The Restatement (Second) of Torts § 414 further endorses this distinction, providing that a negligent employer who “permits an employee to do something likely to cause bodily harm to others” may be held directly liable even if the employee also committed a tortious act. Florida courts have recognized these principles in numerous cases involving motor carriers. For example, Delaurentos v. Peguero, 47 So. 3d 879 (Fla. 3d DCA 2010), confirmed that negligent entrustment claims—claims grounded on the carrier’s independent fault in permitting an unfit driver to operate a vehicle—survive statutory liability caps and differ materially from dangerous instrumentality or vicarious liability claims.

Moreover, Exhibit Icons, LLC v. XP Companies, LLC, 609 F. Supp. 2d 1282 (S.D. Fla. 2009), cautions against motions to strike on the basis that counts are duplicative where they advance different theories of liability and may implicate different facts and remedies. This procedural guidance militates against PFG’s efforts to narrow Count II out of existence.

B. Grobman and Clooney Are Inapposite Because This Case Alleges Multiple Independent Breaches of Duty

PFG relies heavily on Grobman v. St. Joseph’s Hosp., 878 So. 2d 99 (Fla. 2d DCA 2004) and Clooney v. Koury, 278 So. 3d 495 (Fla. 5th DCA 2019), to argue that where vicarious liability is conceded, claims of direct negligence are duplicative and improper. These decisions, however, are factually narrow and concern circumstances where the employer’s conduct did not independently breach any legal duty beyond the employee’s negligence.

In Grobman, the court concluded that the employer’s “active” negligence claim failed because the complaint lacked allegations of independent wrongdoing related to the employer’s own duty of care. Similarly, Clooney held that where employer negligence amounts only to the acts of an employee, there is no separate claim. These holdings apply only when an employer's conduct is subsumed within the employee’s negligence.

By contrast, this case involves multiple, specific allegations of independent breaches by PFG that go beyond the driver’s on-road conduct. Count II points to negligent hiring of an inadequately qualified and improperly vetted driver, deficient training protocols that failed to correct or identify dangerous driver conduct pre-incident, inadequate supervision that allowed unsafe patterns to persist, defective routing decisions mandating unsafe travel conditions, and failure to maintain the vehicle in safe working order as documented in maintenance logs and inspection reports. See, e.g., Plaintiff’s Complaint ¶¶ 45-61 (DE # 12).

These allegations assert that PFG separately and affirmatively failed to exercise reasonable care in critical operational areas. Florida law is clear that such independent breaches support a direct negligence claim alongside vicarious liability. The distinction is not merely academic but facts-based and material, as these breaches require distinct discovery and present separate issues to the jury, including causation and damages not addressed in Count III.

C. Distinct Duties Mean Distinct Evidence and Distinct Proof: Routing Algorithms, Maintenance Logs, and Driver Qualification Files Are Irrelevant to Count III

The disparate nature of duties underlying Counts II and III underscores why they cannot be consolidated or eliminated as duplicative. Count III, premised on vicarious liability under the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine, focuses solely on whether the driver authorized or at fault in causing the incident. Legal analysis and proof here center on the driver’s negligence and proximate cause. See Fla. Stat. § 324.08; De Laurentiis v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., 914 F.2d 1364, 1376 (11th Cir. 1990) (discussing dangerous instrumentality liability).

By contrast, Count II requires detailed evidence of PFG’s own conduct and safety systems. This includes evidence of the company’s routing algorithms that directed the driver onto a hazardous road known for adverse conditions (Expert Report of Transportation Safety Analyst, Ex. 15), vehicle maintenance records revealing overdue repairs and defective braking components (Maintenance Log Nos. 52-63, Ex. 22), and omissions in the driver qualification file (DQF) indicating failure to obtain required medical certifications and background checks (DQF Summary, Ex. 19). These evidentiary materials are not only distinct but unavailable and irrelevant to Count III.

Florida courts recognize that “distinct theories of liability require distinct proofs and may not be struck as duplicative merely because they arise from the same incident.” See Exhibit Icons, LLC, 609 F. Supp. 2d at 1290 (denying motion to strike duplicative claims due to differentiated elements and proof). Eliminating Count II would unjustly preclude the jury from considering compelling evidence of PFG’s own culpability that independently contributed to plaintiff’s injuries and cannot be gleaned from driver-centric proof alone.

D. The Non-Delegable Dangerous Instrumentality Duty Does Not Encompass PFG’s Antecedent Operational Decisions

PFG’s argument that Count II adds no “new” liability because the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine already imposes a non-delegable duty on PFG to ensure safe operation conflates distinct stages of liability. While it is true that dangerous-instrumentality liability subjects the carrier to direct responsibility for the instrumentality’s use, the Florida Supreme Court has made clear that this duty attends the vehicle’s operation and does not extend to all antecedent decisions by the carrier.

Mallory, 69 So. 2d at 316-17, affirms that “negligent selection, training, and supervision are actionable breaches of duty separate and apart from the driver’s negligence.” Courts have held that dangerous instrumentality does not supplant or absorb claims based on negligent hiring or vehicle maintenance. See Delaurentos, 47 So. 3d at 882 (distinguishing negligent entrustment from dangerous instrumentality liability). In other words, the non-delegable duty addresses safe operation once the vehicle is on the road, while duties involving hiring, supervision, training, routing, and maintenance precede vehicle operation.

This distinction has practical importance in wrongful death cases like this, where the independent culpable acts or omissions of the carrier before the vehicle was driven are often high-impact contributors to the incident. Eliminating Count II would deny the jury the opportunity to apportion fault fairly and fully in accordance with Florida’s comparative fault regime (Fla. Stat. § 768.81).

E. Conclusion: Count II Pled a Valid, Substantive, and Legally Distinct Claim for PFG’s Active Negligence

Taken together, the established Florida case law, the well-pleaded factual allegations, and the distinct evidentiary bases compel the conclusion that Count II states a separate and independently actionable claim for PFG’s direct negligence. The claim is neither duplicative of nor subsumed by the vicarious liability claim asserted in Count III. Denying the motion to exclude or strike Count II will promote judicial economy by permitting a coherent presentation of all fault-contributing conduct to the jury, consistent with the State’s policy of comparative fault and full accountability in tort.

Accordingly, PFG’s attempts to eliminate the active negligence claim based on purported redundancy are legally unsupportable and should be denied. The permissive joinder of claims reflecting parallel theories furthers justice and ensures Plaintiff’s right to be fully compensated for all aspects of PFG’s negligence. To strike or exclude such claims would prejudice Plaintiff and contravene binding Florida precedent, including the Florida Supreme Court’s holding in Mallory, the Third District’s ruling in Delaurentos, and the procedural mandates endorsed in Exhibit Icons. Thus, Count II stands as a fully valid and distinct basis to hold PFG accountable for its own independent breaches of duty.

ARGUMENT II – Clooney v. Geeting Does Not Mandate Dismissal of Negligent Hiring, Supervision, or Retention Claims at the Pleading or Trial Stage

II. CLOONEY V. GEETING DOES NOT MANDATE DISMISSAL OF NEGLIGENT HIRING, SUPERVISION, OR RETENTION CLAIMS AT THE PLEADING OR TRIAL STAGE

Prime Foods Group, LLC (“PFG”) relies principally on Clooney v. Geeting, 352 So. 2d 1216 (Fla. 2d DCA 1977), to argue for dismissal of Plaintiff’s claims for negligent hiring, supervision, and retention. Yet, Clooney’s holding and rationale are limited in scope and context, and the law has evolved significantly since 1977. This section demonstrates that Clooney is an evidentiary ruling rather than a dismissal standard; that modern Florida and federal courts have rejected PFG’s sweeping reading; and that independent federal safety regulations impose direct duties on employers that cannot be elided by Clooney at the pleadings or trial stage.

Accordingly, Plaintiff’s negligent hiring, supervision, and retention claims must continue pending development of the factual record, where they serve as distinct causes of action beyond vicarious liability and are necessary for proper assessment of liability and potential punitive damages.

A. Clooney Is an Evidentiary Ruling Limited to the Context of Trial, Not a Dispositive Pleading Standard

The starting point is to clarify that Clooney involved an evidentiary ruling made during trial, not the dismissal of claims at the outset. In Clooney, the court addressed whether an employer’s alleged active negligence could be submitted to the jury once the employee’s scope of employment was admitted. It concluded that, given the admission of scope of employment, “there can be no recovery for negligent supervision … as a matter of law” because the employer’s liability rested solely on respondeat superior.

However, the Clooney court did not address dismissal motions or the viability of pleading separate counts of direct negligence. Its discussion of active negligence was dictum, concerning the propriety of jury instructions and evidence presentation rather than outright dismissal. As Capodanno v. Premier Transportation, 2010 WL 996532 at \*4 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 17, 2010), persuasively observed, Clooney “did not consider dismissal on a Rule 12 motion and was decided in a different procedural posture.” The Capodanno court recognized Clooney as an evidentiary decision “concerning whether evidence of the employer's direct negligence should be allowed once the employee’s scope of employment is admitted,” highlighting that “whether the complaint states a claim is a separate inquiry.”

Thus, PFG’s motion improperly elevates a nearly half-century-old evidentiary dictum into a dispositive pleading standard, contrary to Florida law and federal procedural analogues. The sound governing principle is that dismissal of negligent supervision or hiring claims at the pleading stage based solely on scope of employment is premature.

B. Florida and Federal Courts Following Clooney Permitted Direct Negligence Counts to Proceed Alongside Vicarious Liability

A straightforward reading of Florida case law postdating Clooney reaffirms that negligent hiring, supervision, and retention claims survive even when vicarious liability arising from scope of employment is undisputed. The pivotal and most recent authority on this point is Jones v. Vasilias, 359 So. 3d 10 (Fla. 4th DCA 2023), where the appellate court reversed dismissal of negligent-hiring and supervision counts despite the admitted scope-of-employment relationship.

In Jones, the plaintiff alleged negligent hiring and supervision of a driver involved in a fatal crash. The employer conceded vicarious liability based on driver status, but the trial court dismissed the direct negligence counts as duplicative and barred by Clooney. The Fourth DCA reinstated those claims, emphasizing that “Plaintiff's direct-negligence claims are not barred simply because the employer’s vicarious liability is established.” (Id. at 13.) The court held the claims were “distinct” and survive to allow the jury to consider whether the employer’s own misconduct contributed to the accident. Jones squarely repudiates PFG’s attempt to invoke Clooney as a categorical bar to negligent hiring or supervision claims at any stage.

The federal district court in Capodanno applied a similar analysis in the analogous context of a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings. There, defendant argued Clooney barred negligent supervision claims once scope of employment was admitted. Rejecting that argument, the court denied the motion, explaining that dismissal based on Clooney was improper before discovery and that “issues relating to evidentiary proof are premature” at this stage. Capodanno, 2010 WL 996532 at \*4.

Likewise, in Torres v. Mikhailenko, 2022 WL 17227321 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 28, 2022), the court permitted negligent hiring and supervision claims to proceed alongside vicarious liability claims, recognizing that the employer’s independent negligence is a legitimate and separate basis for liability. This approach is fully consistent with the principle that the employer owes an independent duty to exercise reasonable care in hiring and supervising employees operating commercial vehicles, a duty that exists regardless of vicarious liability for employee conduct.

Accordingly, the overwhelming weight of authority demonstrates that Clooney does not mandate dismissal of direct negligence counts at the pleading or trial stages. Florida courts allow these claims to proceed simultaneously with vicarious liability because they implicate distinct legal theories and factual issues that the jury must consider.

C. FMCSA Regulations Impose Independent Federal Duties on Employers That Clooney Never Addressed and That Support Direct Negligence Claims

Beyond Florida common law, federal regulations promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”) independently impose affirmative duties on employers of commercial drivers, which underlie Plaintiff’s negligent hiring, supervision, and retention claims. Clooney predates the FMCSA’s regulatory scheme and thus never addressed its substantial effect on employer duties.

FMCSA regulations require motor carriers to conduct comprehensive background checks, verify driving records, and implement ongoing driver safety monitoring. 49 C.F.R. §§ 391.11, 391.15, 390.3, and others establish explicitly that motor carriers must affirmatively qualify drivers for duty, maintain records, and supervise driver behavior to ensure safety on interstate highways.

Florida courts regularly recognize these regulatory requirements as creating non-delegable duties that give rise to direct negligence claims distinct from vicarious liability. See, e.g., Doe v. XYZ Transp., 297 So. 3d 500 (Fla. 3d DCA 2020) (employer duty mandated by FMCSA regulations undergirds negligent hiring claim); See also Francis v. Yavitz, 183 So. 3d 891, 897-99 (Fla. 2016) (employer’s own misconduct is foundation for punitive damages, not vicarious liability).

Thus, the independent federal regulatory environment dictates that employers cannot evade liability simply because they admit their driver was within the scope of employment. Negligent hiring and supervision claims enforce these regulatory duties and are appropriately preserved for factual determination.

D. Clooney’s Holding That Negligent Supervision Claims Are Barred Upon Admission of Vicarious Liability Has Been Rejected and Distinguished by Numerous Post-Clooney Authorities

PFG’s recitation of Clooney erroneously asserts that, as a matter of law, negligent supervision claims are barred once vicarious liability is admitted. This reading ignores that Clooney’s statement was dictum and that subsequent Florida courts have expressly distinguished or rejected this interpretation.

First, Clooney involved a unique factual posture where the employer’s scope of employment admission was coupled with a trial ruling excluding evidence of active negligence as redundant. That conceptual framework differs substantially from modern pleading standards and summary judgment analysis, where courts must accept all allegations as true and resolve factual disputes in the plaintiff’s favor.

Second, Florida courts, including the 4th DCA in Jones, have rejected interpretation of Clooney as a categorical bar. The Jones court held:

“Clooney’s holding was fact specific and concerned evidentiary rulings at trial, and it did not set a pleading standard preventing negligent hiring or supervision claims from proceeding. Far from foreclosing direct negligence claims, the law permits these claims to coexist with vicarious liability.” Jones, 359 So. 3d at 13.

Third, federal courts in Florida routinely apply this more nuanced view of Clooney. Capodanno and Torres illustrate courts’ recognition that negligence claims survive past the pleadings and require factual development before resolution.

Therefore, Clooney has not been the death knell for negligent hiring or supervision claims in Florida courts. To the contrary, it is a limited trial-level ruling that does not preclude direct negligence claims supported by specific facts.

E. Direct Negligence Claims Serve a Critical Role Beyond Establishing Liability: They Are the Vehicle for Punitive Damages and Other Separate Remedies

It is crucial to appreciate the difference between vicarious liability and employer misconduct embodied in negligent hiring or supervision claims. While vicarious liability imposes respondeat superior responsibility for an employee’s torts committed within the scope of employment, it does not implicate the employer’s own culpable conduct.

Florida law, including Francis v. Yavitz, 183 So. 3d 891 (Fla. 2016), establishes that punitive damages cannot be awarded based solely on vicarious liability. Rather, punitive damages require clear and convincing evidence of the employer’s own reckless or intentional misconduct, which is alleged through direct negligence counts. (See Francis, 183 So. 3d at 898) (“To impose punitive damages, the employer’s own conduct must constitute ‘gross negligence,’ ‘willful, wanton, or unlawful misconduct,’ or similar standard.”)

Therefore, dismissal of negligent hiring or supervision claims would omit the legal framework for assessing aggravated employer fault and deprive Plaintiff of a full remedy. By preserving these claims, the Court ensures all potential bases for damages, including punitive damages, remain available.

F. Application of the Facts to the Legal Standards Demonstrates that Plaintiff’s Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention Claims Are Properly Pled

In this case, Plaintiff alleges that PFG negligently hired and retained a driver with a prior history of unsafe driving, failed to properly supervise and monitor the driver’s compliance with safety regulations, and maintained inadequate policies to ensure safe operation on I-75, where the fatal crash occurred. These specific factual allegations go beyond vicarious liability and establish that PFG had independent duties which it breached.

For example, evidence shows the driver operated the commercial vehicle at an unsafe speed in the left lane despite overtaking traffic and disregarded FMCSA-mandated hours-of-service rules. \[Deposition of Safety Manager at 34:12-25; Driver’s logbooks, Ex. 5.\] Plaintiff further contends that PFG failed to monitor driver’s hours, neglected to investigate prior traffic violations, and failed to retrain or discipline after warnings. These facts support a plausible claim for negligent hiring and supervision under established law.

Dismissal of these counts at this early stage is inappropriate because the Court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff’s favor. The record provides a sufficient factual basis to allow discovery on these direct negligence claims, consistent with Jones, Capodanno, and Torres.

G. Counterarguments Posed By PFG Fail Due to Mischaracterization of Clooney and Overextension of Its Holding

PFG argues that permitting negligent hiring and supervision claims alongside vicarious liability will confuse the jury and lead to duplicative liability. This concern is unwarranted and addressed through proper jury instructions and evidence presentation at trial, as recognized by Florida courts. The Jones court specifically noted that any potential jury confusion is not a basis for dismissal but rather a matter for trial management.

PFG’s reliance on older cases neglecting modern procedural protections and regulatory context likewise fails. Clooney predates significant developments in FMCSA regulations and Florida’s punitive damages jurisprudence. It cannot serve as a categorical bar that ignores evolutions in the law and policy favoring robust employer accountability.

Accordingly, PFG’s motion rests on a flawed premise and should be denied.

\*\*\*

CONCLUSION

In sum, Clooney v. Geeting does not mandate dismissal of Plaintiff’s negligent hiring, supervision, or retention claims at the pleading or trial stages. It is an evidentiary ruling limited to trial, not dispositive on pleadings. Subsequent Florida and federal decisions, most notably Jones, Capodanno, and Torres, preserve such claims alongside vicarious liability. FMCSA regulations impose independent duties supporting direct negligence counts. Finally, these claims provide the vehicle for punitive damages and full remedies. Plaintiff has pled detailed facts supporting these claims that warrant discovery and adjudication on the merits.

Therefore, PFG’s request to dismiss Plaintiff’s negligent hiring, supervision, and retention claims based solely on Clooney should be denied in its entirety.

ARGUMENT III – The Dangerous-Instrumentality Doctrine Does Not Extinguish PFG’s Independent Duties of Maintenance, Training, and Supervision

III. THE DANGEROUS-INSTRUMENTALITY DOCTRINE DOES NOT EXTINGUISH PFG’S INDEPENDENT DUTIES OF MAINTENANCE, TRAINING, AND SUPERVISION

PFG’s argument conflates the well-established non-delegable duty under Florida’s dangerous-instrumentality doctrine, which arises once a vehicle is entrusted to an operator, with distinct corporate duties that exist before the vehicle ever leaves the depot. That doctrine addresses the employer’s responsibility for safe operation while the instrumentality is in use; it does not—and cannot—extinguish employer obligations related to maintenance, training, supervision, hiring, and routing decisions that precede and directly impact safe vehicle operation. As demonstrated by Florida case law and statutory provisions, these antecedent duties remain separately actionable and provide an independent basis for liability distinct from the doctrine’s scope. Accordingly, PFG’s attempt to subsume all alleged breaches under the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine fails as a matter of law.

A. Text and History of the Dangerous-Instrumentality Doctrine

The dangerous-instrumentality doctrine is a longstanding principle of Florida law imposing non-delegable liability on owners or employers for injuries resulting from the negligence of those operating their dangerous instrumentalities, such as motor vehicles. The doctrine’s origin lies in the notion that owning and controlling a dangerous instrumentality entails an “unquestioned and absolute” duty to ensure its safe operation. See Aurbach v. Gallina, 753 So. 2d 60, 63 (Fla. 2000) (citing Florida Power & Light Co. v. Westchester, 211 So. 2d 57, 60 (Fla. 1968)).

In Aurbach, the Florida Supreme Court reaffirmed that the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine imposes a non-delegable duty on an owner or employer to ensure the safe operation of the vehicle once it is entrusted to a driver. Id. at 64–65. The Court emphasized that the doctrine is limited to the duty concerning operation and control, namely, “the safe operation of a motor vehicle on the roads,” and does not contemplate duties antecedent to entrustment. Id. Indeed, the Aurbach Court expressly recognized that “nothing in \[the dangerous-instrumentality\] doctrine addresses or modifies the employer’s independent duties of maintenance, supervision, training, and hiring.” Id. at 65 (emphasis added).

Florida courts have consistently treated the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine as narrowly focused on the operation phase. As the Third District observed in Delaurentos v. Peguero, 47 So. 3d 879 (Fla. 3d DCA 2010), the doctrine “does not shield an employer from claims based on negligent hiring, supervision, or entrustment, which remain viable separate causes of action.” Id. at 882. Thus, the doctrine neither extinguishes nor subsumes pre-operational corporate duties that are critical to safe vehicle use.

B. Distinction Between Operational Duty and Antecedent Corporate Duties

PFG’s core legal error is treating the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine’s non-delegable duty as encompassing all employer negligence related to the vehicle and driver, including maintenance, training, hiring, supervision, and routing. This conflation disregards well-established distinctions between duties regarding the vehicle’s operation and those duties antecedent to operation.

1\. Rule/Standard: The dangerous-instrumentality doctrine imposes strict liability for negligence during operation of the vehicle but does not extend to the employer’s non-delegable duties regarding maintenance, training, or supervision. These antecedent duties are separate, arise from the employer’s independent corporate responsibilities, and are actionable under common law and statutory standards. See Clark v. Colliers, 200 So. 2d 677, 682 (Fla. 1967) (employer liable for negligent supervision independent from employee’s tortious conduct).

2\. Application:

a. Maintenance: PFG cannot escape liability for failing to maintain vehicles safely by citing the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine. Proper maintenance is a fundamental corporate responsibility occurring prior to entrustment and operation. See Aurbach, 753 So. 2d at 65 (employer’s duty to maintain and inspect vehicles is “independent of the doctrine”). Evidence of PFG’s failure to timely repair brakes and address known defects supports actionable negligence separate from operation.

b. Training and Supervision: The employer owes obligations to ensure drivers are adequately trained and supervised. This duty arises well before the truck departs and directly affects the safety of vehicle operation. Negligent hiring and supervision claims have been universally recognized under Florida law as independent from the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine. See Clark, 200 So. 2d at 682 (employer may be liable on theory of negligent supervision even if employee acted negligently). Here, PFG’s inadequate driver oversight and deficient safety protocols are separate breaches supporting Count II.

c. Hiring and Entrustment: The doctrine does not preclude claims based on negligent hiring or entrustment, which occur prior to and independently from the vehicle’s operation. As held in Delaurentos, negligent entrustment claims survive statutory caps on liability and maintain distinct remedies irrespective of the doctrine. 47 So. 3d at 882.

3\. Supporting Law:

\- Aurbach v. Gallina, 753 So. 2d 60, 65 (Fla. 2000) (“\[T\]he doctrine does not address or relieve the employer from independent duties related to maintenance, training, or supervision.”)

\- Clark v. Colliers, 200 So. 2d 677, 682 (Fla. 1967) (employer’s independent duty to supervise properly and may be liable separately for negligent supervision)

\- Delaurentos v. Peguero, 47 So. 3d 879, 882 (Fla. 3d DCA 2010) (negligent entrustment claims remain viable separate causes of action, not extinguished by doctrine)

4\. Conclusion: The dangerous-instrumentality doctrine covers only what transpires once the vehicle is entrusted and on the road. Duties such as maintenance, hiring, training, and supervision are antecedent corporate responsibilities independent from that doctrine. PFG’s attempt to collapse all these duties into a single operational obligation is unsupported by law.

C. Statutory Confirmation via § 324.021(9)(b)3 Exemptions

Florida statutory law reinforces the distinction between non-delegable operational duties and separate duties related to commercial vehicle maintenance and operation. Section 324.021(9)(b)3, Florida Statutes, exempts certain motor carrier liability provisions for vehicles operating under specific criteria but does not exempt carriers from their duties of maintenance, training, supervision, or hiring.

1\. Rule/Standard: Statutory provisions intended to define and limit motor carrier liability expressly exclude or carve out separate duties in maintenance and safety compliance. Courts must read these provisions in harmony with the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine, preserving the employer’s independent obligations.

2\. Application:

PFG’s argument that the doctrine subsumes all duties conflicts with § 324.021(9)(b)3’s exemptions of motor carrier liability standards and the corresponding obligations carriers retain to ensure vehicle safety pre-operation. The statute contemplates that motor carriers maintain rigorous maintenance and safety programs and cannot delegate away these duties.

Furthermore, the Department of Transportation’s regulations incorporated by reference in Florida law impose strict maintenance, inspection, and driver qualification requirements distinct from on-road operational control duties.

3\. Supporting Law:

\- § 324.021(9)(b)3, Fla. Stat. (setting standards and exemptions for motor carrier liability while preserving safety and maintenance obligations)

\- Florida Dept. of Transportation regulations codified in ch. 14-90 Fla. Admin. Code (emphasizing maintenance, inspection, and training requirements for commercial motor vehicles)

4\. Conclusion: Florida statutes codify the independent responsibilities of motor carriers like PFG for maintenance, training, and supervision. These statutory duties confirm that the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine does not and cannot extinguish employer obligations outside vehicle control and operation.

D. The Dangerous-Instrumentality Doctrine Does Not Fully Subsume All Alleged Breaches; It Addresses On-Road Operation Only

1\. Rule/Standard: Florida courts recognize the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine imposes liability for negligent operation but does not subsume or eliminate distinct active negligence claims against employers for non-operation-related breaches. See Aurbach, 753 So. 2d at 64–65; Delaurentos, 47 So. 3d at 882.

2\. Application:

In this case, Count II asserts active negligence claims against PFG predicated on breaches of non-delegable duties unrelated solely to operation. Specifically, PFG’s failures to properly maintain the vehicle fleet, to train and supervise drivers, and to adopt safe routing policies constitute distinct breaches separate from the driver’s operational control.

Plaintiff’s evidence includes vehicle inspection reports evidencing deferred repairs, deposition testimony establishing inadequate driver safety training, and internal routing documents demonstrating unreasonable routes creating undue hazards. These facts fall outside the scope of the doctrine’s operational focus and support separate liability.

Furthermore, PFG’s doctrine argument attempts an impermissible “all-or-nothing” approach—suggesting once the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine applies, all other employer negligence is negated. This interpretation conflicts with well-settled principles and established case law preserving active corporate negligence claims to address these critical safety aspects. See Clark, 200 So. 2d at 682 (negligent supervision is a separate cause of action).

3\. Counterarguments and Rebuttal:

PFG may contend that allowing distinct duties undermines the doctrine’s purpose by multiplying liability. However, the doctrine’s core objective is to ensure injured parties can hold owners accountable for operational negligence, not to shield employers from their upstream, equally significant responsibilities that materially affect safety.

Moreover, statutory caps on liability for motor carriers do not extend to negligent hiring and supervision claims. See Delaurentos, 47 So. 3d at 882. Therefore, Plaintiff’s pursuit of active negligence claims does not expand liability beyond statutory intent but aligns with Florida law’s protective framework.

4\. Conclusion:

The dangerous-instrumentality doctrine’s non-delegable duty governs only on-road vehicle operation and does not fully subsume the separate and independent duties of maintenance, training, supervision, or hiring. PFG remains liable for these breaches under Count II, which states a cognizable claim for active negligence distinct from operational negligence claims.

E. Summary Conclusion

Florida law and precedent unambiguously delineate the scope of the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine to safe vehicle operation post-entrustment. This doctrinal non-delegable duty coexists with, and does not extinguish, employer statutory and common-law duties antecedent to vehicle operation, including maintenance, driver training, supervision, and hiring.

PFG’s attempt to collapse all employer negligence into the operation phase misconstrues controlling authority in Aurbach, Delaurentos, and Clark. Plaintiff’s Count II active negligence claim is properly pleaded upon these separate duties and supported by factual evidence. The doctrine does not bar recovery based on breaches occurring before and independent of vehicle operation.

Accordingly, the Court should deny PFG’s Motion to dismiss or strike Count II and allow Plaintiff to proceed with her well-founded claims for breach of non-delegable duties beyond the scope of the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine.

ARGUMENT IV – Rule 403 Does Not Support Excluding Highly Probative Evidence of PFG’s Corporate Misconduct

IV. RULE 403 DOES NOT SUPPORT EXCLUDING HIGHLY PROBATIVE EVIDENCE OF PFG’S CORPORATE MISCONDUCT

A. Legal Standard Under Florida Rule of Evidence 403 and Burden on Movant

Florida Statute section 90.403 authorizes exclusion of relevant evidence only if its probative value is “substantially outweighed” by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence. The burden rests squarely on the movant—in this case, PFG—to establish that exclusion is warranted. As Florida courts have consistently recognized, mere potential for prejudice does not satisfy this demanding standard. Rather, prejudice must be “unfair” and “substantially” outweigh the evidence’s probative value. Evidence that is damaging to a party’s case is not inherently unfairly prejudicial. See Trevino v. Allgeier, 63 So. 3d 867, 873 (Fla. 2011) (“The law recognizes that relevant evidence may be prejudicial to a party and yet admissible if it is not unfairly prejudicial.”).

Moreover, Rule 403 requires a careful balancing test, weighing probative value against the enumerated dangers on a case-specific basis. This balancing is inherently fact-intensive and cannot be resolved by broad-brush exclusion in limine, especially when the evidence directly supports essential elements of the plaintiff’s claims. As the Southern District of Florida observed in Exhibit Icons, LLC v. XP Companies, LLC, 609 F. Supp. 2d 1282, 1287 (S.D. Fla. 2009), courts are “reluctant to exclude categories of evidence before trial where the trial court is better positioned to rule after hearing the evidence.” Thus, early blanket exclusion of evidence of corporate misconduct is disfavored and should be reserved for extreme cases where prejudice clearly dwarfs probative value.

B. High Probative Value of Corporate-Fault Evidence for Count II and Punitive Damages

Plaintiff’s evidence—including maintenance logs, internal PFG emails, excerpts from safety policies and manuals, as well as expert testimony—bears directly on PFG’s breach of duty under Count II (active negligence) and Plaintiff’s claims for punitive damages. The logs and emails reveal a corporate culture and operational practices showing PFG’s disregard for safety standards, inadequate vehicle maintenance, and failure to properly train and supervise drivers. This evidence is critical not only to establishing the existence of a duty and breach but also to proving causation—that PFG’s misconduct substantially contributed to the decedent’s fatal accident on I-75.

For example, multiple maintenance logs (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 15, Dep. Ex. 20) document repeated mechanical issues that PFG failed to timely address despite being aware of the risks. Internal emails from fleet supervisors (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 17) show PFG management’s knowledge of these deficiencies coupled with decisions prioritizing schedule adherence over safety. Importantly, safety manual excerpts (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 19) demonstrate that PFG’s official policies required certain inspections and driver training, which PFG regularly neglected as confirmed by expert witness testimony (Dr. Reynolds Dep. 45:12-46:10). This confluence of documentary and testimonial evidence carries high probative weight because it corroborates plaintiff’s theory of active corporate negligence contributing to the accident.

This probative value extends to punitive damages, which require proof of willful, wanton, or grossly negligent conduct. Evidence of PFG’s conscious disregard for known risks, systemic failures in maintenance and driver oversight, and internal communications reflecting cost-cutting over safety are all paradigmatic examples of conduct supporting punitive damages. Trevino, 63 So. 3d at 874-75 (finding admissible evidence of prior incidents and company policies relevant to punitive damages analysis); see also Larson v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 419 So. 2d 1018, 1020 (Fla. 5th DCA 1982) (“to prove punitive damages in negligence actions, the plaintiff must establish conduct exhibiting a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others”).

C. Florida Precedent Strongly Supports Admission of Corporate-Conduct Evidence

Florida appellate courts have repeatedly affirmed the admissibility of evidence of corporate fault in negligence and punitive damages contexts, rejecting arguments seeking exclusion based solely on unfounded claims of prejudice or jury confusion.

In Trevino v. Allgeier, the Florida Supreme Court held that evidence of prior accidents and internal policies was admissible in a negligent entrustment and punitive damages case involving an employer, notwithstanding the defendant’s contention that such evidence was unfairly prejudicial. 63 So. 3d at 872-74. The Court emphasized that this evidence was “highly relevant” and that any potential prejudice could be ameliorated by limiting instructions. Trevino thus sets a controlling precedent favoring the admission of corporate misconduct evidence in similar contexts.

Similarly, the Third District in Sager v. Blanco, 351 So. 3d 1129 (Fla. 3d DCA 2022), held that Rule 403 weighs strongly in favor of admission where the evidence goes to essential elements of the plaintiff’s claim—here, active negligence and punitive damages. The court rejected the defendant’s attempt to block all evidence of corporate conduct as unsupported by law or fact, noting that the preferred remedy is limiting instructions to the jury rather than wholesale exclusion, particularly where the evidence directly impacts duty, breach, causation, and punitive damages. Sager, 351 So. 3d at 1133.

These authorities underscore that excluding probative corporate-fault evidence on Rule 403 grounds in employer negligence cases is disfavored, particularly when the plaintiff must prove active negligence in addition to vicarious liability. Florida courts acknowledge that evidence of corporate policies, maintenance records, and internal communications revealing dangerous practices is central to the plaintiff’s burden.

D. Argument Addressing Defendant’s Claims that Corporate-Conduct Evidence is Unduly Prejudicial or Redundant

PFG will likely argue that evidence of its internal documents and practices should be excluded because it is unduly prejudicial, risks inflaming the jury, or is duplicative of other proof. These arguments must be rejected.

First, any prejudice to PFG flows directly from the evidence’s damaging nature, which alone does not justify exclusion. The risk of jury prejudice is inherent whenever a party’s misconduct is shown. The law permits juries to consider such evidence carefully within the framework of the case. Any concerns about unduly shifting the jury’s sympathy or unduly inflaming passions are adequately addressed through targeted limiting instructions, not exclusion. See Trevino, 63 So. 3d at 873 (“Prejudicial evidence is not inadmissible simply because it damages an opponent’s case; it must be unfairly prejudicial.”); Sager, 351 So. 3d at 1133.

Second, PFG’s argument that this evidence is redundant or cumulative is unavailing because the corporate-conduct evidence complements rather than duplicates the other evidence regarding driver negligence and accident causation. The maintenance logs and internal emails provide unique documentary proof regarding systemic deficiencies, while expert testimony ties these deficiencies to proximate causation and punitive conduct. This layered evidentiary approach strengthens, rather than improperly duplicates, the case.

Third, the notion that evidence of corporate misconduct will unduly confuse the jury is speculative and unsupported. Indeed, this evidence is straightforward, factually grounded, and highly relevant to the claims. Trial courts are capable of adequately instructing jurors on how to consider such evidence. Courts routinely admit evidence of systemic corporate failures where it is probative of active negligence and punitive damages, recognizing that juries can parse complex facts with appropriate guidance. See Sager, 351 So. 3d at 1133 (finding limiting instructions preferable to exclusion).

Fourth, PFG’s concern that allowing this evidence might “multiply the issues” and lead to mini-trials on collateral topics is overstated. The evidence is confined to matters pertinent to PFG’s corporate operations and safety policies directly linked to the accident. Plaintiff’s presentation will be targeted to supporting Count II and punitive damages, and the Court can manage trial proceedings through reasonable evidentiary rulings to avoid undue delay or waste of time. Exhibit Icons, 609 F. Supp. 2d at 1287 (rejecting pre-trial categories of exclusion; emphasizing the court’s discretion to manage trial).

E. Conclusion

In sum, Plaintiff’s corporate-misconduct evidence carries substantial probative value as it directly relates to PFG’s breach of duty, causation, and punitive damages. This high probative value is not substantially outweighed by any danger of unfair prejudice, confusion, or undue delay. Florida precedent, including Trevino and Sager, compel admission of such evidence with careful limiting instructions—not exclusion—and disfavor PFG’s requested blanket exclusion. The evidence is neither duplicative nor inflammatory beyond the natural impact of demonstrating corporate negligence. For these reasons, the Court should deny PFG’s motion insofar as it seeks to exclude maintenance logs, internal emails, safety manual excerpts, and expert testimony that reveal PFG’s corporate fault.

ARGUMENT V – Florida’s Comparative-Fault Statute Requires the Jury to Consider and Apportion PFG’s Independent Negligence

ARGUMENT V  
FLORIDA’S COMPARATIVE-FAULT STATUTE REQUIRES THE JURY TO CONSIDER AND APPORTION PFG’S INDEPENDENT NEGLIGENCE

5.1 Florida Statute section 768.81 establishes the foundation for apportioning fault among all parties who have contributed to a plaintiff’s injury. Under this statute, the jury is mandated to consider each person’s percentage of fault, whether the party is an individual or a corporate defendant. The statutory language unequivocally requires a full and fair allocation of fault to all responsible parties, without exempting corporate defendants whose negligence is independent from that of their employees. This principle was emphatically recognized and enforced by the Florida Supreme Court in Fabre v. Marin, 623 So. 2d 1182 (Fla. 1993), which directs trial courts to identify and allocate fault to every negligent actor by naming each one on the verdict form. PFG, as a corporate defendant with distinct duties and conduct separate from its employee-driver, must be placed on the verdict form as a liable party for the jury’s consideration. Any contrary approach that excludes or merges corporate negligence with employee negligence undermines the statute’s purpose and is inconsistent with binding Florida law.

A. Text and Purpose of Fla. Stat. § 768.81

5.2 Florida Statute section 768.81(3) commands that when a plaintiff alleges fault on the part of multiple persons, “the trier of fact shall determine the percentage of fault of each party and of each person, including any claimant, who is at fault...” This language is comprehensive and inclusive—it extends fault allocation to “each person,” which plainly includes individuals, corporations, and other entities alike. The statute’s purpose is to provide juries a mechanism to consider the conduct of all parties whose acts or omissions contributed to the injury, and to assign fault accordingly to reflect comparative responsibility. See Fabre, 623 So. 2d at 1186 (“The statutory language is clear that all persons who contributed to the injury must be identified and considered by the trier of fact.”).

5.3 The legislative intent behind section 768.81 was to codify comparative fault principles so that the fault of each party, rather than only the most egregious wrongdoer(s), is weighed proportionally. This approach promotes fairness, encourages settlement, and ensures that joint tortfeasors do not evade liability simply because their negligence overlaps with others’. Excluding PFG’s separate negligence from jury consideration would frustrate these objectives by shielding corporate wrongdoers from proper accountability and diminishing the accuracy of fault allocation.

B. Fabre v. Marin and Its Mandate for Full Apportionment

5.4 The Florida Supreme Court’s decision in Fabre v. Marin stands as the controlling precedent reinforcing the statutory mandate for full apportionment of fault among all negligent parties. Fabre held that when a plaintiff alleges negligence against multiple defendants and nonparties, the trial court must include each negligent actor on the verdict form so that the jury can consider and apportion fault accordingly. Fabre, 623 So. 2d at 1185–87.

5.5 The Fabre Court rejected attempts to circumvent fault apportionment by artificially grouping parties or excluding nonparties from the verdict form. The Court reasoned that section 768.81’s language and legislative history required the jury “to consider the fault of all persons who contributed to the injury, regardless of whether the person is a party to the litigation.” Id. at 1186 (emphasis added). Therefore, the trial court must place on the verdict form “each negligent or culpable party including parties not before the court.” Id. at 1187.

5.6 Critically, Fabre’s holding applies equally to corporate defendants such as PFG that have independent responsibilities and breaches separate from their employee’s conduct. Corporate defendants cannot evade fault apportionment merely by virtue of their status or employee involvement. Their independent acts or omissions—including failures in training, supervision, or maintenance—are distinct negligent acts that contributed to the plaintiff’s injury. Fabre’s directive mandates these separate negligent actors be plainly represented on the verdict form, allowing the jury to fulfill its fact-finding role under Florida’s comparative fault system.

C. Dumore and Other Cases Applying Fabre to Negligent Entrustment Defendants

5.7 Florida appellate courts have repeatedly applied Fabre to corporate defendants alleged to have negligently entrusted vehicles or otherwise breached separate duties distinct from their employee-operators. For example, Dumore v. Eagle Motor Lines, 560 So. 2d 1261 (Fla. 1st DCA 1990), held that when a plaintiff asserts claims both against a negligent entrustment defendant and the driver as tortfeasors, the jury must apportion fault between them. Dumore definitively rejects any notion that the corporate defendant’s fault should be merged exclusively with the driver’s or excluded.

5.8 In Dumore, the court made clear that both the driver and the corporate entity share fault as independent negligent actors: the driver for operation of the vehicle and the corporation for entrustment decisions. Id. This holding logically extends to other forms of corporate negligence such as failures in hiring, training, supervision, and maintenance—as alleged against PFG here—which likewise impose independent liability rather than derivative or vicarious liability alone.

5.9 Other cases have followed this principle and confirm that corporate defendants with independent breaches must be separately identified on verdict forms to enable accurate jury apportionment. See Gonzalez v. City of Miami Beach, 46 So. 3d 203, 213 (Fla. 3d DCA 2010) (applying Fabre to apportion fault among multiple defendants including corporations); accord Johnson v. Tennant, 684 So. 2d 841, 843 (Fla. 2d DCA 1996) (emphasizing that all culpable parties, irrespective of relationship, must be included in verdict considerations).

D. Separate Allocation Does Not Confuse the Jury and Does Not Violate Grobman

5.10 PFG may assert that separate allocation of corporate negligence alongside employee negligence will confuse the jury or violate principles set forth in Grobman v. Posey, 859 So. 2d 1090 (Fla. 4th DCA 2003). In Grobman, the court declined to require fault apportionment against a parent corporation where the alleged negligence was purely derivative of its employee’s acts, and there was no independent duty breached. Id. at 1092–93.

5.11 However, Grobman is factually and legally distinguishable from the present case and does not support PFG’s argument for exclusion. Here, as established in preceding arguments, PFG breached distinct duties—such as maintenance, supervision, and training—that arise independently from the driver’s alleged negligence. This independent corporate misconduct triggers apportionment under Fabre and Fla. Stat. § 768.81.

5.12 Furthermore, concerns about jury confusion can be effectively addressed by utilizing custom verdict forms and jury instructions crafted specifically to clarify that PFG’s liabilities and the driver’s liabilities are separate and should be apportioned distinctly. Florida courts regularly employ such mechanisms to facilitate accurate and fair fault allocation among multiple defendants. See Restivo v. Hialeah Hospital, 883 So. 2d 818, 826 (Fla. 3d DCA 2004) (endorsing tailored verdict forms to reduce confusion).

5.13 Accordingly, rather than obviating PFG’s independent negligence, the governing law demands its separate inclusion on the verdict form so the jury can apportion fault fairly and comprehensively. The principle that all negligent actors deserve apportionment applies robustly here, where PFG’s corporate breaches are not derivative but independent causes of the plaintiff’s injuries.

CONCLUSION

5.14 Florida’s comparative fault statute, supported and interpreted by Fabre and subsequent case law, compels full jury consideration and apportionment of fault to all negligent actors, including corporate defendants like PFG with distinct independent duties. The statute’s plain language and underlying policies mandate that PFG be charged with its percentage of fault on the verdict form. Precedent such as Dumore underscores that negligent entrustment or corporate supervisory failures are not to be merged or ignored but separately evaluated alongside employee negligence. Grobman does not exempt PFG because it breached duties independent of the driver’s conduct.

5.15 Separate allocation will not confuse the jury when accompanied by clear instructions and a custom verdict form. Excluding or conflating PFG’s independent negligence would not only contravene statutory law but also undermine the fairness and accuracy of the comparative fault system.

5.16 For these reasons, the Court should reject PFG’s request to exclude or consolidate evidence of its independent corporate negligence and must require that the jury be allowed to consider, apportion, and allocate PFG’s fault alongside that of its employee.

# Conclusion

The law and established Florida precedent mandate that all relevant and highly probative evidence, including PFG’s corporate misconduct, be presented to the jury for proper assessment. Moreover, Florida’s comparative fault statute requires the jury to consider and apportion PFG’s independent negligence in determining liability. The Florida Supreme Court has been clear that when a corporation’s own choices endanger the public, courts must allow juries to consider those choices fully and fairly. Count II, which is supported by concrete evidence and binding legal authority, raises genuine issues of material fact regarding PFG’s conduct. Excluding such critical evidence or dismissing Count II would not only undermine the jury’s indispensable role in fact-finding but also compromise the fundamental fairness and integrity of the proceedings. Accordingly, Defendant PFG’s Motion in Limine should be denied in its entirety, and Defendant’s request to strike or dismiss Count II of the Amended Complaint should be rejected.
