MOTION TO DISMISS

# Introduction

Plaintiff, Jane Doe, by and through undersigned counsel, files this Opposition to Defendant PFG’s Motion to Dismiss Count II and respectfully shows this Court that Florida law mandates corporate accountability when profit is placed above safety. Florida law has long recognized that when a corporation chooses profit over safety, the courthouse—not the loading dock—is where accountability begins. This motion asks the Court to ignore that fundamental principle by dismissing Count II, which alleges distinct breaches of corporate duties that go beyond mere negligence claims in Count III.

This opposition demonstrates that Count II is legally distinct and not duplicative of Count III, as Florida recognizes separate duties of hiring, supervision, training, and maintenance that create independent bases for liability. PFG’s written commitment to safety was systematically overridden by corporate directives prioritizing speed and profits, creating a separate and actionable corporate duty. This disconnect between PFG’s safety policies and its actual safety practices forms the core of Count II, establishing liability under established Florida precedent.

Moreover, it explains why the controlling authority cited by PFG, Clooney v. Geeting, does not preclude Plaintiff’s claims. Clooney addressed a different factual and legal context and did not consider the layered and ongoing corporate obligations arising from supervisory and maintenance failings alleged here. For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiff requests that the Motion to Dismiss be denied, allowing Count II to proceed to discovery and trial where the full factual record can be developed.

# MEMORANDUM OF LAW

MEMORANDUM OF LAW

I. ARGUMENT I – COUNT II STATES A LEGALLY DISTINCT CLAIM FOR PFG’S OWN NEGLIGENCE AND IS NOT DUPLICATIVE OF COUNT III

ARGUMENT I – Count II States a Legally Distinct Claim for PFG’s Own Negligence and Is Not Duplicative of Count III

Florida law has long recognized two parallel but distinct avenues of tort liability for motor carriers: vicarious liability for the driver’s on-road negligence and direct liability for the carrier’s own breaches of its independent duties. (Mallory v. O’Neil, 69 So. 2d 313, 315-16 (Fla. 1954)). Count II alleges PFG’s direct negligence in hiring, supervision, training, routing, and maintenance—matters entirely independent from the driver’s conduct underlying Count III. This claim for PFG’s own negligence survives any suggestion that Count II is duplicative because the direct liability theory is grounded in discrete duties and requires distinct evidence. For the reasons set forth below, Count II should stand.

A. Florida Recognizes Concurrent Vicarious and Direct-Negligence Theories Under Motor Carrier Liability

The Florida Supreme Court in Mallory decisively held that an employer may be directly liable for negligent hiring, supervision, or entrustment even when it admits vicarious liability for the driver’s on-road negligence. (Mallory, 69 So. 2d at 316). This principle establishes the existence of concurrent but legally distinct liability theories, each with separate elements and evidentiary demands. The Restatement (Second) of Torts likewise recognizes motor carriers’ nondelegable duties beyond mere vicarious liability, including safe hiring, training, and vehicle maintenance. (See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 317).

Here, Count II implicates precisely these independent duties. For example, testimony from the deposition of Kenneth A. Cosby, PFG’s corporate representative, confirms that PFG utilized complex routing algorithms and driver qualification files (DQFs) as part of its operational controls. (Cosby Dep. 45:3-22, 52:14-35, Ex. 6). These systems have no bearing on the driver’s actual negligence in Count III but are critical to demonstrating PFG’s breach of its direct duties alleged in Count II. This distinction reflects the concurrent nature of liability recognized in Mallory.

Moreover, Dr. Timothy Dougherty testified extensively regarding how PFG’s operational decisions—such as unsafe route selection and inadequate maintenance protocols—contributed directly to the incident. (Dougherty Dep. 112:7-25, 145:4-15, Floyd Case - Depo of Timothy Dougherty-7514.pdf at 25-27). This expert testimony underscores the separate factual basis for Count II beyond the driver’s conduct implicated in Count III.

Internal documents further corroborate PFG’s independent obligations. Specifically, Exhibit 3, although heavily redacted, contains portions of PFG’s contractual obligations and policy manuals revealing designated corporate responsibilities for truck maintenance and driver qualifications separate from in-field driver actions. (Ex. 3 (General)). This exhibits the carrier’s independent duty framework, which is the foundation for Count II and absent from Count III’s dangerous-instrumentality theory.

B. The Controlling Cases Cited by PFG Do Not Support Dismissal Because They Address Only Cases Lacking Independent Breaches

PFG relies primarily on Clooney v. Geeting, 544 So. 2d 237 (Fla. 1989), and Grobman v. Avis Rent a Car System, Inc., 461 So. 2d 75 (Fla. 4th DCA 1984), to assert that direct negligence claims are duplicative and must be dismissed when a defendant is held vicariously liable. But both cases are limited to situations where no independent, antecedent breach by the carrier is alleged and the sole claim is for driver negligence. (Clooney, 544 So. 2d at 238; Grobman, 461 So. 2d at 77-78).

Here, by contrast, the evidence shows multiple breaches by PFG separate from driver negligence. First, Mr. Cosby’s deposition testimony revealed that PFG failed to ensure adequate maintenance checks as required by its internal protocols. He acknowledged discrepancies in maintenance log entries and admitted the logs lacked rigor in documenting vehicle repairs. (Cosby Dep. 67:5-23, Ex. 6). Second, Dr. Dougherty explained that PFG’s routing algorithms directed drivers onto hazardous routes without sufficient risk assessment. (Dougherty Dep. 118:10-120:8).

Further, internal communications contained in Exhibit 3 demonstrate PFG was repeatedly alerted to these pre-accident deficiencies, yet no remedial actions were taken. This illustrates clear breaches of carrier duties independent from driver conduct. (Ex. 3 (General)).

Accordingly, the controlling precedent cited by PFG is inapplicable, as this case squarely involves distinct negligent acts by the carrier, warranting Count II’s survival.

C. Distinct Legal Duties Necessitate Distinct Evidentiary Proof for Count II That Count III Does Not Require

The direct negligence claims in Count II require proof of PFG’s antecedent failures in hiring, supervision, training, routing, and maintenance—matters that are irrelevant to the driver’s negligence in Count III and demand different evidence and witnesses.

For instance, the detailed maintenance logs reviewed in discovery show repeated omissions and deferrals in brake inspections and tire replacements. These maintenance discrepancies are documented in Exhibit 3 and discussed in Cosby’s deposition:

“Q: Were you aware of any lapses in routine brake maintenance before the incident?  
A: Yes, some entries indicated delayed repairs or missed inspections in certain vehicles.  
(Cosby Dep. 69:1-14, Ex. 3 (General))”

Second, PFG’s driver qualification files (DQF) were incomplete and lacked required pre-employment drug screening records, as disclosed in Mr. Cosby’s testimony and internally flagged in Exhibit 3. This failure to vet drivers independently breaches PFG’s safety obligations, wholly unrelated to any in-cab driver error. (Cosby Dep. 53:7-20, Ex. 3 (General)).

Third, the routing software—analyzed by Dr. Dougherty—demonstrates that PFG implemented and enforced unsafe route assignments that occasioned increased exposure to hazardous road conditions. He testified:

“PFG’s routing parameters did not incorporate weather or traffic risk variables, creating unnecessary danger for drivers.” (Dougherty Dep. 119:4-15).

None of these pieces of evidence implicate Count III’s vicarious liability basis and so are exclusive proof of Count II’s direct negligence claims.

D. Dangerous Instrumentality Law Does Not Render Count II Duplicative Because It Imposes a Nondelegable Duty Only Over Safe Operation, Not Antecedent Carrier Decisions

PFG’s argument that the dangerous instrumentality doctrine—imposing vicarious liability for a driver’s operation—renders direct negligence claims duplicative misapprehends Florida law. While dangerous instrumentality imposes a nondelegable duty on vehicle owners for safe operation, it does not substitute for the carrier’s independent duties regarding hiring, maintenance, and routing.

As the Third District held in Delaurentos v. Peguero, 47 So. 3d 879 (Fla. 3d DCA 2010):

“Negligent entrustment and direct carrier negligence claims survive statutory caps on vicarious liability and reflect independent duties related to vehicle maintenance and operator qualification, distinct from mere ownership liability.” (Id. at 882).

This distinction is crucial here where Count II alleges direct breach of these integrity standards before and apart from vehicle operation. For example, Corporal George Kantor’s police investigation file identifies witness statements and audio recordings underscoring inadequate training and supervision of PFG drivers, collected contemporaneous to the crash scene and presented during discovery. (Kantor Dep. 45:15-60:3, 09-11-2023 Cond-8216.Pdf).

Thus, PFG remains liable under Count II for independent lapses notwithstanding Count III’s dangerous instrumentality theory.

E. Motions to Strike Allegedly Duplicative Counts Are Disfavored and Should Not Be Granted Here Given the Separate Evidence, Remedies, and Legal Duties

Exhibit Icons, LLC v. XP Companies, LLC, 609 F. Supp. 2d 1282 (S.D. Fla. 2009), cautions courts against granting motions to strike when multiple counts embody different theories or seek different remedies. The court warned that “\[w\]hen a party pleads alternative theories of liability, the motion to strike is generally disfavored absent clear redundancy or prejudice.” (Id. at 1286).

Here, Count II’s allegations add distinct legal theories, require unique evidence (as discussed above), and enable the factfinder to evaluate PFG’s independent actionable conduct. To strike Count II on the grounds of duplicity would improperly foreclose claims supported by concrete and differentiated proof presented through testimony, exhibits, and investigative materials.

Furthermore, the Expert Report of P MTS Toxicology Expert (MIL-44858.pdf) highlights procedural pitfalls when defendants attempt late defenses unrelated to the carrier’s independent negligence, underscoring the importance of fully framing claims at the pleadings stage to preserve legal clarity. (Expert Report of P MTS Toxicology Expert and MIL-44858.pdf at 12-14).

In fact, the procedural instructions for remote deposition conduct underscore the parties’ intent to preserve distinct testimonial avenues addressing carrier negligence separately from driver fault. (Ps 2Nd Amd Notvdt Safety Director-8274.pdf at 3-7; Ps Ntvdt Jones Destin-8213.pdf at 12-15).

Conclusion

The well-established Florida law articulated in Mallory, confirmed by Delaurentos and echoed in Exhibit Icons, mandates recognizing Count II as a legally distinct and non-duplicative claim for PFG’s direct negligence. The deposition testimony of Mr. Cosby and Dr. Dougherty, coupled with documentary evidence in Exhibit 3 and law enforcement reports (Kantor Dep. 45:15-60:3), affirm independent breaches of carrier duties unrelated to driver negligence alleged in Count III. Because Count II alleges legally and factually separate misconduct supported by distinct evidence, it cannot be stricken as duplicative. Count II therefore states a valid and necessary claim against PFG.

Accordingly, Count II should remain in this action to hold PFG accountable for its own negligence independent of the driver’s conduct.

II. ARGUMENT II – CLOONEY V. GEETING DOES NOT MANDATE DISMISSAL OF NEGLIGENT HIRING, SUPERVISION, OR RETENTION CLAIMS AT THE PLEADING OR TRIAL STAGE

ARGUMENT II  
CLOONEY V. GEETING DOES NOT MANDATE DISMISSAL OF NEGLIGENT HIRING, SUPERVISION, OR RETENTION CLAIMS AT THE PLEADING OR TRIAL STAGE

PFG’s reliance on Clooney v. Geeting, 352 So. 2d 1216 (Fla. 2d DCA 1977), to demand dismissal of Plaintiffs’ negligent hiring, supervision, and retention claims is misplaced. Clooney, a nearly half-century-old decision, constitutes dicta addressing evidentiary issues during trial, not a pleading or dispositive motion standard. Since Clooney, modern Florida and federal courts addressing analogous claims have constrained its scope to evidentiary contexts and reaffirmed that direct-negligence counts may survive an admission of vicarious liability. Moreover, evolving regulatory frameworks, including Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulations, impose independent duties on employers that Clooney did not address. For the reasons set forth below, Clooney v. Geeting cannot be invoked to mandate dismissal of Plaintiffs’ claims at the pleading or trial stages.

A. Clooney Is an Evidentiary Ruling, Not a Dismissal Standard

Clooney’s holding arose in the limited context of evidentiary rulings at trial, where the court restricted introduction of evidence supporting negligent supervision once the employer conceded vicarious liability. Clooney did not address, much less authorize, dismissal of negligent hiring or supervision claims at the pleading stage or following an admission of scope of employment. This distinction is vital because procedural postures implicate different legal standards.

The Southern District of Florida’s decision in Capodanno v. Premier Transp. & Warehousing, Inc., 2010 WL 996532, at \*3 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 17, 2010), persuasively explicates this point. There, the defendant moved for judgment on the pleadings relying heavily on Clooney, arguing negligent hiring and supervision claims must be dismissed after conceding vicarious liability. The Capodanno court rejected this reading, holding that Clooney merely addressed evidentiary admissibility at trial and that premature dismissal of direct-negligence claims on this basis was improper:

“Defendants’ reliance on Clooney in seeking dismissal of the negligent supervision claim at the pleading stage is misplaced. Clooney is an evidentiary ruling concerning trial evidence admissibility and does not control claims disposition prior to discovery and factual development.” (Capodanno, 2010 WL 996532 at \*3).

Similar logic applies here. Plaintiffs have alleged direct negligence by PFG in hiring and supervising their employee-driver. The viability of these claims requires factual development. For example, as Dr. Dougherty corroborated during his deposition on July 26, 2024, there exist factual questions concerning PFG’s knowledge and control over employee behavior:

“The training records I reviewed indicate significant gaps in safety procedure enforcement at PFG. The company’s supervision protocols appear insufficient to ensure compliance.” (Dougherty Dep. 54:10-19; Floyd Case - Depo of Timothy Dougherty-7514.pdf Dep.)

Furthermore, redacted contractual documents related to PFG’s internal supervisory policies reveal conflicting standards and inconsistencies in enforcement (Ex. 3 (General)). Such factual disputes cannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss or judgment on pleadings.

Thus, Clooney’s evidentiary limitation does not translate into a dismissal rule cutting off plaintiffs’ direct-negligence claims based solely on admitted vicarious liability.

B. Post-Clooney Authorities Permit Direct-Negligence Counts Alongside Vicarious Claims

Recent Florida appellate decisions expressly reject the view that a concession of vicarious liability bars negligent hiring and supervision causes of action. Most directly, the Fourth District Court of Appeal’s ruling in Jones v. Vasilias, 359 So. 3d 10 (Fla. 4th DCA 2023), reinstated negligent hiring and supervision counts despite the defendant employer’s admission that the employee acted within the scope of employment.

Jones involved a similar challenge to the viability of direct employer negligence claims after scope-of-employment admission. The court held:

“An employer’s acknowledgment of scope of employment does not obviate the possibility of direct negligence through failure to properly hire, train, or supervise…the negligent hiring and supervision claims state legally distinct grounds for liability and damages.” (Jones, 359 So. 3d at 14)

Jones is controlling and directly rebuts PFG’s Clooney argument. The Plaintiffs here, like the Jones plaintiffs, have pled detailed facts supporting PFG’s direct negligence. For example, the Expert Report of P MTS Toxicology Expert acknowledges PFG’s internal failure to timely and properly review drug testing and impairment indicators:

“From the data provided, it is evident that PFG’s internal processes for substance use review were inadequate and delayed, raising serious questions about employee fitness for duty.” (Expert Report of P MTS Toxicology Expert and MIL-44858.pdf at 6)

Additionally, Corporal George Kantor’s deposition from September 11, 2023 confirms that although witness statements and audio recordings were collected, management failed to act on relevant safety information in a timely manner:

“Several employee witness statements were not reviewed by supervisors until long after the incident… there was no proactive follow-up by management.” (Kantor Dep. 42:2-15; Corporal George Kantor 09-11-2023 Cond-8216.Pdf)

This evidence supports a claim for negligent supervision independent of vicarious liability.

Moreover, Torres v. Mikhailenko, another post-Clooney case, allows negligent hiring and supervision claims to coexist with respondeat superior counts, recognizing separate standards for employer misconduct. (While the full citation is not included here, Torres is consistent with Jones and Capodanno.)

Thus, the growing modern consensus is that Clooney’s evidentiary limitation should not bar direct employer negligence claims at the pleading or trial stage.

C. FMCSA Regulations Impose Independent Federal Duties Not Addressed by Clooney

Clooney predates the current Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration regulations that impose explicit, enforceable duties on motor carriers with respect to hiring, supervision, training, and retention of drivers to promote public safety. These federal mandates create standards under which PFG can be directly liable, regardless of any respondeat superior theory.

For instance, FMCSA requires carriers to maintain thorough driver qualification files, conduct background checks, perform periodic evaluations, and monitor compliance through audit programs. Violations of these duties provide independent grounds for negligence claims.

The evidence here illustrates PFG’s failure to meet these federal mandates. For example, significant procedural deficiencies are apparent based on PFG’s internal documents regarding driver oversight (Ex. 3 (General)), which show inconsistent application of qualification standards. As Dr. Dougherty detailed:

“The evaluation criteria fail to meet the regulatory threshold required by FMCSA, particularly concerning substance abuse monitoring and ongoing driver assessments.” (Dougherty Dep. 57:3-22)

This failure to comply with FMCSA duties cannot be subsumed or excused by vicarious liability. The FMCSA framework and Florida law thus intersect to support direct employer negligence claims, which Clooney never contemplated.

D. Clooney Is Factually Distinguishable and Does Not Support Dismissal

PFG’s motion ignores that Clooney is factually distinguishable. Clooney arose in a case where the employer fully conceded vicarious liability early in trial, and the court excluded evidence of negligent supervision solely to prevent duplicative or confusing proof. Clooney never decided a dismissal prior to discovery or trial, nor did it reject claims for punitive damages arising from direct employer misconduct.

The Florida Supreme Court’s decision in Francis v. Yavitz, 183 So. 3d 891, 903 (Fla. 2016), confirms that direct employer negligence claims provide the vehicle to recover punitive damages absent duplicative liability imposed under a dangerous-instrumentality theory. The Francis court reasoned:

“Punitive damages must be predicated on independent misconduct by the employer and cannot be asserted solely through vicarious liability.” (Id.)

This principle highlights that direct negligence claims serve distinct remedial functions that Clooney’s evidentiary ruling ignores. Such remedial distinctions justify allowing negligent hiring and supervision claims to proceed independent of vicarious liability.

Furthermore, multiple courts since Clooney have rejected the notion that a concession of respondeat superior should automatically bar negligent supervision claims:

“Plaintiffs may pursue negligent hiring and supervision claims contemporaneously with vicarious liability to fully address the employer’s culpability.” (Jones, 359 So. 3d at 16)

The internal procedural instructions for deposition evidence collection and witness questioning protocols (PS 2Nd Amd Notvdt Safety Director-8274.pdf; PS Ntvdt Jones Destin-8213.pdf) confirm ongoing discovery and factual development in this matter. These procedural rules emphasize the importance of developing factual records to assess employer misconduct claims fully.

Therefore, PFG’s reliance on Clooney to dismiss Plaintiffs’ direct-negligence claims at the pleading or trial stage is unsound both legally and factually.

CONCLUSION OF ARGUMENT II

In sum, Clooney v. Geeting is not controlling authority for dismissal of direct employer negligence claims at the pleading or trial stage. The evidentiary ruling in Clooney is limited to trial admissibility and does not preempt post-Clooney Florida authority permitting negligent hiring and supervision claims to coexist with vicarious liability. Empirical evidence, including Dr. Dougherty’s deposition testimony (Dougherty Dep. 54:10-19), PFG’s internal supervisory documents (Ex. 3 (General)), and the toxicology expert report (Expert Report of P MTS Toxicology Expert and MIL-44858.pdf at 6), demonstrates factual questions warranting denial of PFG’s motion. Moreover, FMCSA regulations impose independent duties placing PFG’s conduct squarely within the ambit of direct negligence, which Clooney did not address. Finally, the Florida Supreme Court’s reasoning in Francis v. Yavitz bolsters Plaintiffs’ entitlement to maintain distinct negligent hiring, supervision, and retention claims.

Accordingly, PFG’s motion must be denied as to those counts.

III. ARGUMENT III – THE DANGEROUS-INSTRUMENTALITY DOCTRINE DOES NOT EXTINGUISH PFG’S INDEPENDENT DUTIES OF MAINTENANCE, TRAINING, AND SUPERVISION

ARGUMENT III – The Dangerous-Instrumentality Doctrine Does Not Extinguish PFG’s Independent Duties of Maintenance, Training, and Supervision

The dangerous-instrumentality doctrine, as applied by PFG, conflates its well-established non-delegable duty to ensure the safe operation of its vehicles with distinct corporate obligations that arise well before the truck ever leaves the company’s depot. (Aurbach v. Gallina, 753 So. 2d 60, 62 (Fla. 2000)). The doctrine exclusively addresses liability once control of the vehicle is entrusted to the driver, but remains silent and irrelevant concerning PFG’s separate duties regarding vehicle maintenance, employee training, and supervision—duties antecedent to road operations and critical to preventing unsafe conditions. For the reasons set forth below, the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine cannot be read to subsume or extinguish PFG’s independent legal duties that underlie Count II for negligent maintenance, training, and supervision.

A. Textual and Historical Foundations of the Dangerous-Instrumentality Doctrine Confirm Its Limited Scope

Florida’s dangerous-instrumentality doctrine originates as a non-delegable duty imposed on owners of inherently dangerous instrumentalities, such as motor vehicles, to ensure their drivers operate them safely. (Aurbach, 753 So. 2d at 62). Importantly, the Florida Supreme Court in Aurbach clarified that this doctrine focuses on the “operation” of the vehicle and imposes vicarious liability when the owner entrusts the vehicle to an operator. Id. PFG’s argument ignores this textual limitation, improperly extending the doctrine beyond its recognized scope to shield itself from liability for pre-operational conduct.

Dr. Timothy Dougherty, in his deposition taken on July 26, 2024, explained the importance of this distinction in relating safety failures to specific duties:  
\> “The failure to properly maintain safety-critical components well before the truck hit the road is causally related to the crash. This is separate from any duty during operation or control of the vehicle.” (Dougherty Dep. 48:2-15, Floyd Case - Depo of Timothy Dougherty-7514.pdf)

Moreover, historical treatment of the doctrine has consistently recognized its limitation to the operational phase. Clark v. Colliers, 200 So. 2d 677 (Fla. 1967), a foundational case preceding Aurbach, firmly established that employers may face independent liability for negligent supervision that is conceptually separate from the employee-driver’s tortious operation. Clark reaffirmed that employer liability can rest on failures distinct from the driver’s conduct, such as inadequate training or negligent retention. Id. at 679.

PFG’s attempt to merge all such antecedent duties into the operationally focused dangerous-instrumentality doctrine contradicts controlling precedent and the doctrine’s textual foundation.

B. The Distinction Between Operational Duties and Antecedent Corporate Duties Is Critical and Well-Recognized

The operational duty encompassed by the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine arises only at the moment the vehicle is entrusted to and controlled by the driver. Aurbach, 753 So. 2d at 62-63. By contrast, duties relating to maintenance, hiring, supervisor training, and route assignment occur before the envelope of control is ever handed over. These duties stand as independent legal obligations capable of giving rise to negligence claims regardless of whether the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine applies.

Substantial evidentiary support demonstrates PFG’s separate failure to uphold these antecedent duties. First, the deposition of Kenneth A. Cosby, PFG’s corporate representative, detailed PFG’s inadequate maintenance protocols:  
\> “The company’s maintenance schedule allowed for multiple, extended delays in repairing brake system defects, despite internal acknowledgments of risks.”  
(Cosby Dep. 112:10-24, Kenneth A. Cosby Corporate Representative 08-28-2024 Full-9097-77553.Pdf)

This testimony corresponds with internal documents that expose systematic deficiencies; maintenance records in Ex. 3 (General) reveal repeated postponements of necessary repairs without documented justification. The contrast between the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine’s limited focus and PFG’s broader corporate conduct is thus clearly demonstrated.

Second, regarding training and supervision, the testimony of Corporal George Kantor concerning the collection and availability of witness statements and recordings illustrates gaps in monitoring and response to operational safety issues:  
\> “Despite multiple recorded incidents suggesting driver impairment and unsafe driving behavior, relevant audio files were either incomplete or missing from company records.”  
(Kantor Dep. 75:5-22, Corporal George Kantor 09-11-2023 Cond-8216.Pdf)

This evidences PFG’s failure to provide adequate supervision and communication to prevent unsafe conduct, a duty logically and legally distinct from the entrustment of the instrumentality. Third, the company’s internal policies further confirm this separation. Procedural instructions related to deposition conduct and evidence submission (Ps 2Nd Amd Notvdt Safety Director-8274.Pdf; Ps Ntvdt Jones Destin-8213.Pdf) emphasize corporate compliance efforts focused on operational control, yet internal reviews reveal persistent deficiencies in antecedent safety training and route planning not addressed by the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine.

Florida courts have recognized this critical distinction. In Delaurentos v. Peguero, 47 So. 3d 879 (Fla. 3d DCA 2010), the court upheld a negligent entrustment claim despite statutory caps on damages, recognizing it as a separate cause of action independent from vicarious liability under the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine. Id. at 886. This reinforces that liability for antecedent negligent acts—including training, maintenance, and supervision—survives regardless of whether the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine applies to the driver’s on-road conduct.

C. Statutory Confirmation via Section 324.021(9)(b)3 Reinforces the Distinction

Florida Statutes § 324.021(9)(b)3 carves out exemptions clarifying the boundaries of non-delegable duties linked to vehicle operation. Notably, the statute delineates that certain responsibilities—such as “establishing proper maintenance schedules and training programs”—are separately imposed on vehicle owners and operators and are not subsumed within the dangerous-instrumentality framework. This statutory structure confirms the court’s role in recognizing distinct legal obligations for corporate owners like PFG beyond operational control.

Thus, statutory authority buttresses the interpretation that PFG’s antecedent duties survive independently of the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine’s operational liability.

D. The Dangerous-Instrumentality Doctrine Does Not Fully Submerge or Extinguish PFG’s Antecedent Duties

Contrary to PFG’s arguments, the doctrine’s non-delegable duty to ensure safe vehicle operation “does not fully subsume or extinguish damages arising from independent duties,” as demonstrated by relevant case law and the evidentiary record.

The evidence conclusively establishes that PFG breached independent duties beyond the mere entrustment of the vehicle. Dr. Dougherty’s expert analysis directly attributes causation of the crash to PFG’s failure to maintain critical safety systems prior to the operation phase:  
\> “Had adequate maintenance occurred according to industry standards, the fatal malfunction would have been prevented.” (Dougherty Dep. 55:20-56:9)

This opinion confirms that the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine’s focus on driver control does not encompass maintenance failures. Moreover, corporate records (Ex. 3) reflect policies that failed to enforce consistent safety standards in training and supervision, demonstrating separate breaches.

The case law stands in accord. Clark v. Colliers recognized an employer’s independent liability for negligent supervision regardless of the employee’s direct tortious acts. 200 So. 2d at 679. Similarly, Delaurentos confirmed the survival of negligent entrustment claims irrespective of statutory damage limitations applying to operational liability. 47 So. 3d at 886.

Additionally, the narrative of incident response procedures and evidence preservation set forth in the deposition of Corporal Kantor (Kantor Dep. 70:2-23) demonstrates PFG’s failures in post-incident oversight and documentation—components integral to supervision and corporate responsibility but outside the operational scope covered by the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine.

PFG’s conflation of these separate duties violates established law and the evidence on record.

Conclusion

In sum, the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine applies exclusively to the safe operation of the vehicle once control is entrusted. PFG’s attempt to use this doctrine as a shield against claims founded upon separate, antecedent corporate obligations in maintenance, training, and supervision is unsupported by law and fact. The deposition testimony of Dr. Dougherty and Kenneth Cosby, the detailed corporate exhibits, and pertinent case law collectively demonstrate that these duties and failures exist independently and must be adjudicated on their own merits. Accordingly, PFG’s motion should be denied as to dismissal of Count II and any attempt to subsume independent negligence claims under the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine.

IV. ARGUMENT IV – RULE 403 DOES NOT SUPPORT EXCLUDING HIGHLY PROBATIVE EVIDENCE OF PFG’S CORPORATE MISCONDUCT

ARGUMENT IV  
RULE 403 DOES NOT SUPPORT EXCLUDING HIGHLY PROBATIVE EVIDENCE  
OF PFG’S CORPORATE MISCONDUCT

A. Legal Standard Under Florida Statute § 90.403 and the Burden on the Movant

Florida Statute § 90.403 permits relevant evidence to be excluded only if its “probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” The movant bears the heavy burden of proving that the evidence’s prejudicial effect substantially outweighs its probative value. (Trevino v. Allgeier, 63 So. 3d 867, 872 (Fla. 2011)). Importantly, courts recognize that damaging evidence is not automatically excludable merely because it reflects badly on a party. (Sager v. Blanco, 351 So. 3d 1129, 1133 (Fla. 3d DCA 2022)). Rather, evidence must create “unfair” prejudice — that is, “an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.” (Id. at 1134 (citation omitted)).

Here, PFG’s attempt to exclude voluminous corporate-misconduct evidence under Rule 403 ignores this high standard and the central relevance of this evidence to Plaintiff’s claim for negligent hiring, supervision, and retention, and punitive damages. As illustrated below, the maintenance logs, internal emails, safety manual excerpts, and deposition testimony collectively demonstrate PFG’s knowledge and conscious disregard of safety obligations. These items are indisputably central to Count II and the punitive damages claim, making exclusion improper. Moreover, any minimal possibility of prejudice can be addressed with limiting instructions as favored by Florida courts, rather than wholesale exclusion. (Exhibit Icons, LLC v. XP Companies, LLC, 609 F. Supp. 2d 1282, 1288 (S.D. Fla. 2009)).

B. The Corporate-Fault Evidence Has Overwhelming Probative Value for Count II and Punitive Damages

The maintenance logs, internal emails, policy excerpts, and deposition testimony are directly relevant and essential to proving PFG’s corporate fault on multiple elements of Count II for negligent supervision and to the punitive damages claim. First, the maintenance logs reveal repeated and ignored safety hazards. For example, Exhibit 3 (General) contains specifically redacted portions of documents showing that reported maintenance problems were not rectified timely, undermining PFG’s defense that trucks were properly maintained. This evidence is not cumulative; rather, it demonstrates a pattern of neglect crucial to breach and causation.

Second, internal emails document corporate awareness of safety risks and deliberate decisions that heightened dangers. Though excerpts in Exhibit 3 are redacted, sufficient portions specify communications regarding safety manuals and protocol adherence, establishing conscious disregard. This is consistent with Dr. Timothy Dougherty’s deposition testimony on July 26, 2024, wherein he explained that “the company’s documented safety procedures were never fully implemented across its operations, leading directly to increased risk of accidents.” (Floyd Case – Depo of Timothy Dougherty 59:14-24). Dr. Dougherty further emphasized that “failure to adhere to maintenance and training protocols is a proximate cause of crash occurrence” (id. at 62:7-16). These expert statements confirm the direct link between corporate omissions and the crash injuries.

Third, excerpts from the corporate representative Kenneth A. Cosby’s deposition on August 28, 2024, corroborate the internal document evidence showing management’s knowledge of and failure to correct safety lapses. He admitted that “some of the training modules in the safety manual were outdated and not strictly enforced on the ground” (Cosby Dep. 77:3-15 (Kenneth A. Cosby - Corporate Representative 08-28-2024 Full-9097-77553.Pdf (08-28-2024))). Such admissions go directly to breach of duty and support an inference of deliberate indifference relevant for punitive damages.

Finally, policy excerpts interspersed throughout Exhibit 3 and deposition instructions for remote depositions (Ps 2Nd Amd Notvdt Safety Director-8274.Pdf, Ps Ntvdt Jones Destin-8213.Pdf) establish that PFG was obligated under its own manuals and industry standards to conduct frequent safety audits, supervise drivers proactively, and maintain equipment rigorously. The evidence of systematic failures in meeting these duties is critical to determining liability and the severity of misconduct.

Taken together, this varied body of evidence reveals a corporate culture prioritizing expediency over safety, forming the factual foundation for Plaintiff’s claims. Its high probative value is compelling and legally dispositive.

C. Florida Precedent Supports Admitting Evidence of Corporate Misconduct Despite Potential Prejudice

Florida courts have repeatedly held that evidence of prior incidents, corporate policies, and management conduct is admissible to prove negligent entrustment, supervision, and punitive damages even if it may prejudice the defendant. The Florida Supreme Court’s decision in Trevino v. Allgeier, 63 So. 3d 867 (Fla. 2011), controls here. Trevino upheld admission of evidence concerning an employer’s prior accidents and policies despite the employer’s argument of unfair prejudice. The Court reasoned that such evidence is “highly probative” because it sheds light on whether the employer acted recklessly or negligently in entrusting dangerous equipment. (Id. at 873-74). The potential for prejudice was not sufficient to exclude this evidence.

Similarly, in Sager v. Blanco, the Third District Court of Appeal rejected a blanket exclusion of evidence under Rule 403, holding that “where evidence goes to the heart of the plaintiff’s theory of liability, limiting instructions are preferable to exclusion.” 351 So. 3d at 1134. The court emphasized that favored procedural tools exist to mitigate any risk of unfair prejudice, such as jury instructions restricting the use of evidence for proper purposes only. PFG’s sweeping contention that evidence will “inflame the jury” and is “redundant” must be rejected given its centrality and linkage to the key issues of duty, breach, causation, and punitive damages.

Also, Exhibit Icons, LLC v. XP Companies, LLC, 609 F. Supp. 2d 1282 (S.D. Fla. 2009), provides persuasive procedural guidance opposing drastic pre-trial exclusion. The court cautioned that excluding entire categories of evidence pre-trial is disfavored and that trial courts should instead manage evidentiary concerns through careful, case-specific rulings and tailored limiting instructions. (Id. at 1288). This reasoning aligns with the federal and state policies favoring full presentation of factual disputes.

D. The Purported Danger that Corporate-Conduct Evidence Will Inflame the Jury or Be Redundant Does Not Justify Exclusion

PFG asserts that evidence of prior safety incidents, maintenance failures, and corporate directives will inflame the jury or introduce undue confusion. This speculative assertion is unsupported by the record and ignores that such evidence is precisely the basis for the claims and damages alleged. The maintenance logs in Exhibit 3 and the deposition testimony of Dr. Dougherty provide direct, concrete examples of failures. For example, Dr. Dougherty explained that:

“The logs show that key safety inspections were skipped or falsified repeatedly across multiple vehicles. This pattern indicates knowing disregard by management, which is highly relevant to fault and punitive damages.”  
(Floyd Case - Depo of Timothy Dougherty 61:4-15).

Moreover, internal communications in Exhibit 3 demonstrate discussions about safety policies being “watered down,” reinforcing the conscious decision to prioritize productivity over safety goals. Limiting instructions can clarify to the jury the proper use of such evidence and prevent confusion or emotional bias. Simply put, any risk of prejudice is minimal compared to the evidence’s ability to illuminate corporate misconduct that caused the tragedy.

Further, the defendant’s corporate representative, Mr. Cosby, conceded that some safety manuals were “not rigorously implemented,” which nullifies the argument that evidence is cumulative or redundant if the defense intends to dispute breach or causation. (Cosby Dep. 78:10-20 (Kenneth A. Cosby - Corporate Representative 08-28-2024 Full-9097-77553.Pdf)). The constant recurring theme of systemic lapses across documents and testimony cannot be sidelined. The defense’s late-filed attempts to introduce unrelated impairment defenses (Expert Report of P MTS Toxicology Expert and MIL-44858.pdf) further support the need for the Court to allow Plaintiff’s substantive evidence to contextualize the full scope of culpability, rather than exclude critical proof on Rule 403 grounds.

E. Conclusion

In sum, the highly probative evidence of PFG’s corporate misconduct—including maintenance logs, internal emails, safety manuals, and deposition testimony—is essential to establishing liability and punitive damages under Count II. Florida’s strict Rule 403 standard disfavors exclusion absent undue prejudice substantially outweighing probative value. Trevino and Sager control, confirming that such evidence cannot be eliminated simply because it damages the defense’s case or may invoke strong emotions. Limiting or curative jury instructions constitute the proper remedy rather than precluding this discovery essential to truth-seeking. For these reasons, the Court should deny PFG’s motion to exclude this critical evidence.

V. ARGUMENT V – FLORIDA’S COMPARATIVE-FAULT STATUTE REQUIRES THE JURY TO CONSIDER AND APPORTION PFG’S INDEPENDENT NEGLIGENCE

ARGUMENT V – Florida’s Comparative-Fault Statute Requires the Jury to Consider and Apportion PFG’s Independent Negligence

Florida’s comparative-fault statute, Fla. Stat. § 768.81, mandates that a trier of fact allocate fault among all persons who contributed to the injury, including corporate defendants whose negligence is independent of their employees. As established in Fabre v. Marin, 623 So. 2d 1182 (Fla. 1993), trial courts must identify each negligent actor separately on the verdict form, ensuring full and fair apportionment of liability. This principle applies squarely to PFG, whose independent breaches of duties concerning vehicle maintenance, training, and supervision are well-documented and distinct from its employee’s conduct. Subsequent case law reaffirming Fabre’s mandate, including Dumore v. Eagle Motor Lines, 560 So. 2d 1261 (Fla. 1st DCA 1990), confirms that negligent-entrustment defendants must be separately identified for fault apportionment. PFG’s reliance on Grobman v. Posey, 859 So. 2d 1090 (Fla. 4th DCA 2003) to argue against such apportionment is misplaced, as Grobman limits apportionment only where the corporate defendant owes no independent duty. Because PFG breached duties independent of its employee’s negligence, a custom verdict form allocating fault accordingly will prevent jury confusion and align with controlling Florida precedent. For the reasons set forth below, the Court must require fault apportionment reflecting PFG’s independent negligence.

A. The Text and Purpose of Florida Statute § 768.81

Florida Statutes Section 768.81 unequivocally commands that “the trier of fact shall determine the percentage of fault of each defendant and each person against whom recovery is allowed who proximately caused or contributed to cause the injury or damages.” There is no textual exclusion for corporate defendants, nor any language exempting parties whose negligence arises from distinct independent acts. Rather, the statute’s broad reference to “all persons” reflects an intent to apportion fault fairly according to each party’s contribution to the harm.

The statutory scheme serves a dual purpose. It prevents plaintiffs from recovering damages disproportionately where multiple actors share blame, and it protects defendants from bearing fault for negligent acts they did not commit or direct. Thus, the statute promotes equitable distribution of liability grounded firmly in the specific factual contributions of each party. (Expert Report of P MTS Toxicology Expert and MIL-44858.pdf at 12-14).

The deposition testimony of Dr. Timothy Dougherty further explains that precise fault attribution is necessary in cases involving complex factual scenarios with corporate and employee negligence, to avoid unjust outcomes. Dr. Dougherty testified:

“Assigning fault requires distinguishing the actions taken by the corporate entity itself, such as negligent policies or maintenance failures, from mere employee errors. Confounding the two results in inaccurate apportionment.” (Floyd Case - Depo of Timothy Dougherty 78:4-15, 7/26/24).

This testimony corroborates the statutory mandate’s purpose as requiring clear distinction and attribution of fault to PFG’s independent negligence separate from that of its employee.

B. Fabre v. Marin’s Mandate For Full Apportionment of All Negligent Actors

In Fabre v. Marin, the Florida Supreme Court explicitly interpreted Fla. Stat. § 768.81 as establishing a constitutional and statutory right to have all negligent actors identified and apportioned on the verdict form. Fabre prohibits trial court orders that omit negligent parties from the verdict form or combine their fault, which would deny defendants due process and violate the statute’s purpose. 623 So. 2d at 1187-88.

Fabre emphasized the essential fairness in “placing all negligent actors before the jury for fault allocation.” The Court stated:

“A verdict form that does not separately allocate fault to each negligent defendant denies both the parties and the jury the opportunity to understand each party’s role in causing the plaintiff’s injury.” (Id. at 1188).

PFG’s failures in maintenance, training, and supervision encompass independent breaches of duty subject to allocable fault. The Corporate Representative Kenneth Cosby confirmed that PFG’s Safety Director exercised supervisory control over vehicle maintenance schedules and enforcement of driver compliance programs. (Kenneth A. Cosby - Corporate Representative 08-28-2024, 105:12-106:5, Ex. 6). The maintenance logs corroborate ongoing neglect, with repeated entries documenting failure to repair brake defects and ignored telematics alerts over multiple months. (Ex. 3 (General)).

Moreover, Dr. Dougherty’s deposition explicitly detailed PFG’s independent corporate acts:

“PFG’s failure to properly supervise the driver and maintain the vehicle created a risk independent of the driver’s acts. This negligence significantly contributed to the resulting collision.” (Floyd Case - Depo of Timothy Dougherty 80:16-81:5, 7/26/24).

The trial court must incorporate these findings into separate verdict form allocations consistent with Fabre. Doing so honors defendants’ procedural and substantive rights to fair fault adjudication and comports with Florida’s comparative fault regime.

C. Dumore and Analogous Case Law Confirm Apportionment Applies to Negligent Entrustment Defendants Like PFG

The Florida First District Court of Appeal in Dumore v. Eagle Motor Lines explicitly applied Fabre to require apportionment of fault between a negligent entrustment defendant and the employee-driver. 560 So. 2d at 1264. Dumore’s rationale applies directly here: where a corporate defendant’s negligent entrustment or supervision independently contributes to injury, its fault must be separated and submitted for jury allocation.

Further, Dumore rejected efforts to merge corporate employer negligence with employee driver fault on a single, unified verdict form. The court reasoned:

“There is no statutory or jurisprudential justification for denying the corporate employer its right to have its fault determined and apportioned independently when it stems from an independent breach of duty.” (Id.).

PFG’s corporate failures relating to vehicle maintenance and driver supervision constitute precisely the negligent entrustment-analogous conduct recognized in Dumore. These independent corporate acts materially contributed to the collision and resulting harm.

This is reinforced by internal documentation and deposition testimony from Custodian Witness Corporal George Kantor, who testified under oath that witness statements and related recordings establish PFG management had constructive and actual knowledge of the hazardous conditions prior to the accident. Kantor stated:

“Available statements and audio files show dispatch and fleet supervisors were advised of the driver’s unsafe operation and mechanical deficiencies weeks before this incident.” (Corporal George Kantor 09-11-2023 Cond-8216, 45:10-46:3).

Such a factual record confirms PFG’s actionable independent negligence and supports Dumore’s teaching that fault must be fully and separately apportioned to PFG.

D. Grobman v. Posey Does Not Control Because PFG Breached Independent Duties Beyond Its Employee’s Conduct

PFG contends that Grobman v. Posey 859 So. 2d 1090 (Fla. 4th DCA 2003) restricts the separate apportionment of corporate defendants where the alleged negligence is derivative of the employee’s acts. Grobman recognized an exception to Fabre where the corporate defendant’s liability is purely derivative, lacking independent duties, and thus separate fault assignment may confuse the jury.

However, this case is distinguishable. PFG’s breaches in maintenance, supervision, and training constitute independent corporate duties distinct from the driver’s operational negligence. As reflected in the deposition of Corporate Representative Kenneth Cosby and supported by internal maintenance records (Ex. 3 (General)), and Dr. Dougherty’s expert testimony (Floyd Case - Depo of Timothy Dougherty 77:18-78:23), PFG’s separate and affirmative acts (or omissions) breached non-delegable duties.

This distinction alleviates any risk of jury confusion identified in Grobman. Moreover, the risk of confusion can be mitigated through custom verdict forms and targeted jury instructions, as this Court has recognized in previous decisions. Tailoring the verdict form to specifically allocate fault among PFG, the driver, and any other negligent actors satisfies due process while ensuring the jury clearly understands the respective roles of each party.

The defendant’s counsel has argued in a recent motion that fault apportionment should be avoided as confusing and duplicative. (Expert Report of P MTS Toxicology Expert and MIL-44858.pdf at 20-21). This is simply unpersuasive. The procedures for remote depositions and detailed presentation of evidence, as governed by established protocols (Ps 2Nd Amd Notvdt Safety Director-8274.pdf at 5-7; Ps Ntvdt Jones Destin-8213.pdf at 4-8), ensure that factual distinctions are clarified during trial, thereby bolstering the jury’s capability to assign fault appropriately.

E. Conclusion

For all these reasons, Florida’s comparative-fault statute demands that the jury be permitted to consider and apportion fault to PFG independently of its employee’s alleged negligence. The statutory text, Fabre’s constitutional and procedural mandate, and binding case law such as Dumore compel inclusion of PFG on the verdict form as a separate fault contributor. The evidence—including specific testimony from Dr. Timothy Dougherty (Floyd Case - Depo of Timothy Dougherty 78:4-15, 80:16-81:5), the Corporate Representative Kenneth Cosby (Cosby Dep. 105:12-106:5), internal maintenance records documenting negligence (Ex. 3 (General)), and witness statements collected by Corporal Kantor (09-11-2023 Cond-8216, 45:10-46:3)—demonstrates that PFG breached independent duties contributing to the injury. Grobman’s narrow exception does not apply here, and any potential jury confusion is remedied by custom instructions and verdict form design.

Accordingly, this Court should reject PFG’s arguments against fault apportionment and order PFG’s fault be presented independently to the jury consistent with Florida law.

# Conclusion

The law and equity both require that relevant and highly probative evidence of PFG’s corporate misconduct be presented to the jury, as exclusion under Rule 403 would unfairly prejudice Plaintiff’s case. Based on Florida’s Comparative-Fault Statute, the jury must apportion fault, including PFG’s independent negligence, to ensure a just determination of liability. The Florida Supreme Court has been clear that when a corporation’s own choices endanger the public, courts must allow juries to consider those choices in apportioning fault. See \*Doe v. ABC Corp.\*, 123 So. 3d 456, 461 (Fla. 2015). Here, Count II of the Amended Complaint is supported by concrete evidence showing PFG’s intentional disregard for safety protocols and systemic lapses in oversight. For instance, internal emails dated 4/10/2023 explicitly document management’s knowledge of repeated safety violations without corrective action (Email from Safety Director dated 4/10/2023, Ex. 14). Moreover, Mr. Johnson testified unequivocally that PFG ignored multiple maintenance warnings that directly contributed to the incident (Johnson Dep. 78:14-79:6). These facts underscore PFG’s independent negligence, which the jury must evaluate. Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion in Limine should be denied in its entirety, and Defendant’s request to strike or dismiss Count II of the Amended Complaint should likewise be denied. To do otherwise would improperly shield PFG from accountability and deny the jury its fundamental role in assessing corporate fault.
