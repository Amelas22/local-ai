O’Neil would have been decided the other way—and thousands of Floridians would be less safe today.\"  ||  Option 4:  \"The dangerous-instrumentality doctrine is a floor, not a ceiling, on an owner’s responsibility; PFG seeks to turn it into a shield against scrutiny.\"  ||  Option 5:  \"Justice cannot be done when the most probative evidence is locked outside the courtroom at the defendant’s request.\""

Secondary Theme—\"Full Story, Full Accountability\": Florida’s comparative-fault system demands that the jury hear the full story of both the driver’s negligence and the company’s independent breaches so that fault can be allocated fairly.  Alternate Theme—\"Corporate Culpability and Deterrence\": Count II is the only vehicle through which punitive damages can deter repeat misconduct that endangers Florida highways."

              "value": "This opposition proceeds in five sections.  First, it demonstrates that Count II is not duplicative of Count III because Florida recognizes independent duties of hiring, supervision, training, and maintenance (Argument I).  Second, it shows why Clooney v. Geeting, on which PFG relies, does not bar a direct-negligence claim at the pleading or trial stages and has been limited by modern precedent such as Jones v. Vasilias (Argument II).  Third, it explains that the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine addresses only the duty of safe operation and cannot swallow antecedent corporate duties (Argument III).  Fourth, it establishes that Rule 403 does not warrant exclusion of highly probative corporate-fault evidence, which is central to causation and punitive damages (Argument IV).  Fifth, it confirms that Florida’s comparative-fault statute requires, rather than forbids, apportionment of fault between PFG’s corporate negligence and Destin’s driving negligence (Argument V).  Each argument weaves record evidence—deposition testimony, internal emails, maintenance logs, and expert opinions—into controlling case law so the Court can rule decisively and efficiently in Plaintiff’s favor."

              "value": "Florida jurisprudence has, for seventy years, recognized two parallel but distinct avenues of tort liability for motor carriers: (a) vicarious liability for a driver’s on-road negligence, and (b) direct liability for the carrier’s own breaches of hiring, supervision, training, routing, and maintenance duties.  Mallory v. O’Neil, 69 So. 2d 313 (Fla. 1954), adopted Restatement §§ 213 and 317, expressly preserving employer negligence claims even when respondeat superior applies.  Subsequent decisions—including Delaurentos v. Peguero, 47 So. 3d 879 (Fla. 3d DCA 2010) and Jones v. Vasilias, 359 So. 3d 10 (Fla. 4th DCA 2023)—confirm that negligent entrustment, hiring, and supervision impose separate duties, support separate remedies (including punitive damages), and may expand liability beyond the dangerous-instrumentality doctrine’s baseline.  The facts here mirror those cases: PFG overrode telematics, ignored brake warnings, compressed background checks, and eliminated safety budgets—choices wholly independent of Destin’s moment-by-moment driving.  Grobman v. Posey, on which PFG relies, concerned a credentialing claim with no independent breach; it did not abolish active-negligence theories and is distinguishable because Plaintiff pleads concrete, antecedent misconduct.  Because Count II targets corporate decisions that existed before Destin ever turned the key, it is neither redundant nor irrelevant.  At the very least, the presence of disputed material facts makes striking or dismissing Count II the antithesis of judicial economy and would invite reversible error under Exhibit Icons, LLC v. XP Companies, LLC, 609 F. Supp. 2d 1282 (S.D. Fla. 2009)."
