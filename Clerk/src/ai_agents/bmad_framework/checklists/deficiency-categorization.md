# Deficiency Categorization Checklist

## Purpose
Guide accurate categorization of RTP request compliance status with consistent criteria

## Categorization Decision Tree

### Step 1: Initial Document Review
- [ ] Search results retrieved for RTP request
- [ ] Relevance scores calculated
- [ ] Document metadata reviewed
- [ ] Date ranges analyzed
- [ ] OC response text examined

### Step 2: Fully Produced Criteria
Check ALL of the following:
- [ ] High relevance scores (>0.8) for multiple documents
- [ ] Complete date range coverage (100%)
- [ ] All requested document types present
- [ ] No significant gaps identified
- [ ] OC response indicates full production
- [ ] Document count meets expectations

**If ALL checked → Categorize as "Fully Produced"**

### Step 3: Partially Produced Criteria
Check if ANY of the following:
- [ ] Some responsive documents found (relevance >0.5)
- [ ] Date range coverage between 25-99%
- [ ] Missing specific document types mentioned
- [ ] Gaps in communication chains
- [ ] OC response admits partial production
- [ ] Related documents reference missing items

**If ANY checked → Categorize as "Partially Produced"**

### Step 4: Not Produced Criteria
Check if ALL of the following:
- [ ] No responsive documents found (relevance <0.3)
- [ ] OC response indicates non-production
- [ ] No privilege claim asserted
- [ ] No "no responsive documents" claim
- [ ] Request clearly seeks existing documents
- [ ] Similar requests show production

**If ALL checked → Categorize as "Not Produced"**

### Step 5: No Responsive Documents Criteria
Check if ALL of the following:
- [ ] OC explicitly states no documents exist
- [ ] Search confirms absence (no results)
- [ ] Explanation is reasonable and specific
- [ ] No contradicting evidence found
- [ ] Request timeframe is reasonable
- [ ] No related documents suggest otherwise

**If ALL checked → Categorize as "No Responsive Documents"**

### Step 6: Special Categories

#### Privileged Documents
- [ ] Privilege log provided
- [ ] Specific privilege claimed
- [ ] Document descriptions match request
- [ ] Privilege claim appears valid

#### Objected To
- [ ] Formal objection stated
- [ ] Legal basis provided
- [ ] No production despite objection
- [ ] Objection scope defined

## Confidence Score Calculation

### High Confidence (0.8-1.0)
- Clear search results
- Explicit OC response
- Multiple supporting factors
- No conflicting evidence

### Medium Confidence (0.6-0.79)
- Good search results
- Ambiguous OC response
- Some supporting factors
- Minor conflicts

### Low Confidence (0.4-0.59)
- Limited search results
- Vague OC response
- Few supporting factors
- Notable conflicts

### Very Low Confidence (<0.4)
- Poor search results
- No clear OC response
- Conflicting indicators
- Requires manual review

## Edge Case Handling

### Split Productions
- Documents from multiple sources
- Partial privilege claims
- Phased production schedule
- Supplemental productions

### Ambiguous Responses
- "See previously produced documents"
- "Responsive documents have been produced"
- General objections without specifics
- References to meet and confer

### Technical Issues
- Corrupted documents
- Inaccessible formats
- Metadata-only productions
- Sampling or exemplar productions

## Quality Checks
- [ ] Category matches evidence
- [ ] Confidence score is justified
- [ ] Edge cases documented
- [ ] Reasoning is clear
- [ ] Evidence citations included

## Final Review
- [ ] Double-check high-priority requests
- [ ] Verify no responsive claims
- [ ] Confirm privilege assertions
- [ ] Document uncertainty areas
- [ ] Flag for attorney review if needed
