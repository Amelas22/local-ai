      Re: {{CASE_CAPTION}} - Good Faith Letter Regarding Discovery Deficiencies
      
      Dear {{OPPOSING_COUNSEL_SALUTATION}}:

  - name: deficiency_summary

      I write to meet and confer in good faith regarding deficiencies in {{PRODUCING_PARTY}}'s 
      discovery production dated {{PRODUCTION_DATE}} in response to {{REQUESTING_PARTY}}'s 
      {{REQUEST_TYPE}} dated {{REQUEST_DATE}}.
      
      As detailed below, the production fails to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 34 
      and this Court's discovery obligations. Specifically:
      
      - {{DEFICIENCY_COUNT}} requests were not fully satisfied
      - {{DOCUMENTS_MISSING}} responsive documents appear to be missing or improperly withheld
      - {{PRIVILEGE_ISSUES}} privilege log deficiencies require correction
    variables:
      - PRODUCING_PARTY
      - PRODUCTION_DATE
      - REQUESTING_PARTY
      - REQUEST_TYPE

      - DEFICIENCY_COUNT

    order: 5
    template: |
      Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 34(b)(2)(C), a party must produce documents as they 
      are kept in the usual course of business and must produce all responsive documents in the 
      party's possession, custody, or control. Rule 26(g) requires that discovery responses be 
      complete and correct as of the time they are made.
      
      The production falls short of these obligations for the reasons detailed below.

      Additionally, the privilege log fails to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
      26(b)(5)(A), which requires that a party withholding information on privilege grounds 
      must:
      
      (i) expressly make the claim; and
      (ii) describe the nature of the documents, communications, or tangible things not 
      produced or disclosed--and do so in a manner that, without revealing information 
      itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess the claim.
      
      Specific privilege log deficiencies include:

      Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37 and this Court's Local Rules require parties to 
      meet and confer in good faith before filing discovery motions. I am therefore writing 
      to attempt to resolve these issues without court intervention.
      
      I am available to meet and confer on {{AVAILABLE_DATES}} to discuss these deficiencies 
      and work toward their resolution.

      To avoid motion practice, we request that you:
      
      1. Supplement your production with all responsive documents within {{RESPONSE_DEADLINE}} days;
      2. Provide amended responses that fully address each request for production;
      3. Serve a compliant privilege log that satisfies Rule 26(b)(5)(A); and
      4. Certify that your supplemental production is complete.
      
      Please contact me at {{CONTACT_INFO}} by {{RESPONSE_DATE}} to confirm receipt of this 
      letter and to schedule our meet and confer session.

      This letter also serves as a reminder of your client's continuing duty to preserve all 
      potentially relevant evidence. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e). Please ensure that all 
      responsive materials are preserved and produced.

      We hope to resolve these issues cooperatively. However, if we cannot reach resolution, 
      {{REQUESTING_PARTY}} reserves the right to file a motion to compel and to seek its 
      reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
      37(a)(5).
