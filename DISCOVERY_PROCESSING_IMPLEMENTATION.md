   - Grid/list view toggle
   - Bulk operations support
   - Real-time fact updates via WebSocket

3. **FactCard.tsx** (`/Clerk/frontend/src/components/discovery/`)
   - Individual fact display with metadata
   - Inline editing capability
   - Edit history tracking
   - Confidence and review status indicators
   - Delete confirmation dialog

4. **PDFViewer.tsx** (`/Clerk/frontend/src/components/discovery/`)
   - PDF rendering with react-pdf-viewer
   - Fact source highlighting using bounding boxes
   - Page navigation controls
   - Zoom controls
   - Multi-fact highlighting support

5. **DiscoveryProcessing.tsx** (`/Clerk/frontend/src/pages/`)
   - Main page component with stepper navigation
   - Case context validation
   - Integration of upload, processing, and review components

### Frontend Hooks and Services

1. **useDiscoverySocket.ts** (`/Clerk/frontend/src/hooks/`)
   - WebSocket event management for discovery processing
   - Real-time fact CRUD operations
   - Auto-reconnection handling
   - Case-based event filtering

2. **discoveryService.ts** (`/Clerk/frontend/src/services/`)
   - API client for discovery endpoints
   - Fact search, update, delete operations
   - Box integration methods
   - Multipart file upload support

### Backend Implementation

1. **discovery_endpoints.py** (`/Clerk/src/api/`)
   - Comprehensive REST API for discovery processing
   - File upload handling (local files + Box integration)
   - Fact CRUD operations with case isolation
   - Bulk operations support
   - WebSocket event emission
   - Case context validation via middleware

2. **Integration with existing services**
   - Uses FactManager for fact operations
   - Leverages CaseIsolatedFactExtractor
   - Integrates with Qdrant vector storage
   - Utilizes WebSocket server for real-time updates

### State Management Updates

1. **discoverySlice.ts** enhancements:
   - Added state for extracted facts
   - Added processing documents array
   - New actions for fact management
   - Real-time update handlers

2. **discovery.types.ts** additions:
   - ExtractedFactWithSource interface
   - FactSource with bounding box data
   - Fact operation request/response types
   - Discovery processing status types

### Tests Created

1. **Backend Tests** (`test_discovery_endpoints.py`)
   - API endpoint testing
   - File upload validation
   - Case isolation verification
   - WebSocket event testing

2. **Frontend Tests**
   - `DiscoveryUpload.test.tsx` - Upload component testing
   - `FactCard.test.tsx` - Fact card functionality
   - `useDiscoverySocket.test.ts` - WebSocket hook testing

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup
1. The discovery endpoints are automatically registered in main.py
2. Ensure all required environment variables are set (Box API, Qdrant, etc.)
3. Case management must be configured (Supabase)

### Frontend Setup
1. Install new dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd Clerk/frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Download PDF.js worker:
   - Replace `/public/pdf.worker.min.js` with actual file from:
   - https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist@3.11.174/build/pdf.worker.min.js

3. Configure Box App (if using Box integration):
   - Add Box App Client ID to environment variables
   - Configure Box App settings for folder picker

## Usage Flow

1. **Case Selection**
   - User must first select a case in the application
   - Case context is maintained throughout the session

2. **Document Upload**
   - Navigate to `/discovery-processing`
   - Upload PDFs via drag-and-drop or Box folder selection
   - Optionally add RFP document for context

3. **Processing**
   - Real-time WebSocket updates show processing progress
   - Documents are split, chunked, and facts extracted
   - Progress visualization with statistics

4. **Fact Review**
   - Review extracted facts in tabbed interface
   - Filter by document, category, confidence
   - Edit facts inline with reason tracking
   - View source highlights in PDF viewer
   - Mark facts as reviewed/rejected

## Key Features Implemented

✅ Multi-source document upload (files + Box)
✅ Real-time processing updates via WebSocket
✅ Fact extraction with source tracking
✅ PDF viewer with bbox highlighting
✅ Inline fact editing with history
✅ Bulk operations (mark reviewed, delete)
✅ Case isolation for multi-tenancy
✅ Comprehensive error handling
✅ Responsive UI with Material-UI

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/discovery/process` - Start discovery processing
- `GET /api/discovery/status/{id}` - Get processing status
- `POST /api/discovery/facts/search` - Search facts
- `GET /api/discovery/facts/{id}` - Get specific fact
- `PUT /api/discovery/facts/{id}` - Update fact
- `DELETE /api/discovery/facts/{id}` - Delete fact
- `POST /api/discovery/facts/bulk` - Bulk operations
- `GET /api/discovery/box/folders` - List Box folders
- `GET /api/discovery/box/files` - List Box files

## WebSocket Events

### Client → Server
- `subscribe_case` - Subscribe to case updates
- `fact:update` - Update fact content
- `fact:delete` - Delete fact

### Server → Client
- `discovery:started` - Processing started
- `discovery:document_found` - Document discovered
- `discovery:chunking` - Chunking progress
- `discovery:fact_extracted` - New fact extracted
- `discovery:completed` - Processing complete
- `discovery:error` - Processing error
- `fact:updated` - Fact updated (broadcast)
- `fact:deleted` - Fact deleted (broadcast)
