## Dev Notes

### Architecture References
[Source: architecture/api-design-and-integration.md]
- WebSocket events for async operations pattern already established
- Use existing `emit_processing_completed()` pattern for new events
- Background tasks via `asyncio.create_task()` for non-blocking execution

[Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]
- Python 3.11+ with FastAPI async/await patterns
- No message queue - use async background tasks
- Socket.io for real-time event emission

[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md]
- DeficiencyService already has `process_deficiency_analysis()` interface
- Service expects production_id and case_name parameters
- Case isolation enforced at service level

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.5:
- DeficiencyService is fully operational with comprehensive report generation
- WebSocket infrastructure supports deficiency-specific events
- API endpoints expect deficiency analysis to be triggered externally
- Report generation can handle async processing with progress tracking

### Key Integration Points
[Source: existing codebase analysis]
**Discovery Completion Hook Location:**
- File: `Clerk/src/api/discovery_endpoints.py`
- Function: `_process_discovery_documents()`
- Line: After line 863 (following `emit_processing_completed()`)
- Context Available: processing_id, case_name, processing_result

**Existing Event Pattern:**
```python
await emit_processing_completed(
    processing_id=processing_id, 
    case_id=case_name, 
    summary=summary
)
```

### Configuration Pattern
[Source: Clerk/config/settings.py]
```python
class DiscoverySettings(BaseSettings):
    # Existing fields...
    enable_deficiency_analysis: bool = Field(
        False, 
        env="DISCOVERY_ENABLE_DEFICIENCY_ANALYSIS",
        description="Enable automatic deficiency analysis after discovery"
    )
```

### Data Model Updates
[Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md]
The DiscoveryProcessingRequest already has optional fields prepared in Story 1.2:
```python
rtp_document_id: Optional[str] = None
oc_response_document_id: Optional[str] = None
```

### Error Handling Pattern
[Source: existing discovery_endpoints.py patterns]
- Use try/except blocks around analysis trigger
- Log errors with `logger.error()` including exc_info=True
- Don't propagate exceptions to discovery process
- Emit specific error events for monitoring

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Framework: pytest with asyncio support
- Mock external services (DeficiencyService)
- Test location: `src/api/tests/test_discovery_endpoints.py`
- Coverage target: >85%
- Test both success and failure scenarios

### Technical Constraints
[Source: CLAUDE.md]
- Functions must be under 50 lines
- Use type hints and Google-style docstrings
- Maintain case isolation in all operations
- Follow existing async/await patterns

### Project Structure Notes
The trigger implementation will be minimal and focused:
- Main logic in existing `discovery_endpoints.py`
- Configuration in existing `settings.py`
- No new files required - only modifications
- Leverages existing WebSocket and service infrastructure

### Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test file location: `src/api/tests/` directory
- Use pytest fixtures for common setup
- Mock external dependencies
- Test async functions with pytest-asyncio
- Run tests in Docker:
  ```bash
  cd /mnt/c/Users/jlemr/Test2/local-ai-package
  docker-compose -p localai -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.clerk.yml exec clerk pytest src/api/tests/test_discovery_endpoints.py -v
  ```
