## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.9 completion notes]
- Good Faith Letter Agent successfully implemented with BMad framework
- Letter generation API endpoints available at `/api/agents/good-faith-letter/*`
- Database persistence implemented with SQLAlchemy models
- Export functionality supports PDF, DOCX, and HTML formats
- Letter customization service with versioning is ready
- WebSocket events established for real-time progress tracking

### Frontend Architecture Overview
[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- **React 18+** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Material-UI (MUI) v5** as component library
- **React Query (TanStack Query)** for server state management
- **React Hook Form** with **Zod** for form validation
- **Socket.io Client** for WebSocket communication
- **Emotion** for CSS-in-JS styling
- **Vite** as build tool

### Component Structure
[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-hierarchy]
The letter preview/export interface should follow the established component hierarchy:
```
GoodFaithLetterPage (Feature Component)
├── LetterPreview (Display Component)
├── LetterEditor (Form Component)
├── LetterVersionHistory (Display Component)
├── LetterExportDialog (Feedback Component)
└── EmailPreparation (Form Component)
```

### API Integration Details
[Source: Story 1.9 API endpoints + docs/architecture/rest-api-spec.md]
Available endpoints for letter management:
- `POST /api/agents/good-faith-letter/generate-letter` - Generate new letter
- `GET /api/agents/good-faith-letter/preview/{letter_id}` - Get letter for preview
- `PUT /api/agents/good-faith-letter/customize/{letter_id}` - Save letter edits
- `POST /api/agents/good-faith-letter/finalize/{letter_id}` - Finalize letter
- `GET /api/agents/good-faith-letter/export/{letter_id}/{format}` - Export letter

### WebSocket Events
[Source: Story 1.9 WebSocket specifications]
Listen for these events:
- `letter:generation_started` - Letter generation begun
- `letter:draft_created` - Initial draft ready
- `letter:customization_applied` - Edit applied
- `letter:finalized` - Letter ready for sending
- `agent:task_progress` - Progress updates during operations

### Data Models
[Source: Story 1.9 + docs/architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md]
```typescript
interface GeneratedLetter {
  id: string;
  report_id: string;
  case_name: string;
  jurisdiction: string;
  content: string;
  status: 'draft' | 'review' | 'approved' | 'finalized';
  version: number;
  agent_execution_id: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at?: string;
  approved_by?: string;
  approved_at?: string;
  edit_history: LetterEdit[];
}

interface LetterEdit {
  id: string;
  letter_id: string;
  version: number;
  editor_id: string;
  editor_name: string;
  section_edits: SectionEdit[];
  edit_timestamp: string;
  edit_notes?: string;
}
```

### UI Component Patterns
[Source: docs/architecture/components.md]
Use these existing component patterns:
- **DocumentViewer** pattern for letter preview with sections
- **TabPanel** for organizing preview/edit/export/email sections
- **DataGrid** for version history display
- **ConfirmDialog** for export/send confirmations
- **LoadingOverlay** for long operations

### State Management
[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management]
```typescript
// Use React Query for server state
const { data: letter, isLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['letter', letterId],
  queryFn: () => api.goodFaithLetter.getLetter(letterId),
  refetchInterval: (data) => 
    data?.status === 'draft' ? 5000 : false,
});

// Use Context for letter editing state
const LetterEditContext = createContext<LetterEditContextValue | null>(null);
```

### Export Format Requirements
[Source: Story 1.9 export service implementation]
- **PDF**: Professional legal formatting with headers/footers
- **DOCX**: Editable format maintaining structure
- **HTML**: Web-friendly format (not exposed in UI initially)

### File Locations
[Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Feature components: `src/features/GoodFaithLetter/`
  - `GoodFaithLetterPage.tsx`
  - `components/LetterPreview.tsx`
  - `components/LetterEditor.tsx`
  - `components/LetterVersionHistory.tsx`
  - `components/LetterExportDialog.tsx`
  - `components/EmailPreparation.tsx`
- API services: `src/services/api/goodFaithLetter.ts`
- Types: `src/types/goodFaithLetter.types.ts`
- Hooks: `src/hooks/useGoodFaithLetter.ts`
- Tests: Co-located in `__tests__/` directories

### Security Considerations
[Source: CLAUDE.md security requirements]
- Case isolation enforced through X-Case-ID header
- Letter access restricted by case permissions
- Edit history tracks user attribution
- Export actions logged for audit trail

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md + docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#testing]
- Use Jest + React Testing Library for component tests
- Mock API calls with MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- Test accessibility with jest-axe
- Coverage target: 80%+
- Co-locate tests in `__tests__/` directories

**Backend Testing Requirements:**
[Source: CLAUDE.md Docker container management]
- All backend testing must occur inside the 'clerk' Docker container
- Copy new and modified files to the container before running tests:
  ```bash
  # Copy files to container
  docker cp src/api/agents/good_faith_letter_endpoints.py localai-clerk-1:/app/src/api/agents/
  docker cp src/services/good_faith_letter_agent_service.py localai-clerk-1:/app/src/services/
  
  # Run tests inside container
  docker exec -it localai-clerk-1 python -m pytest src/api/agents/tests/test_good_faith_letter_endpoints.py -v
  ```
- Do NOT rebuild the container for testing - use file copying for faster iteration
- Ensure test database connections use the container's postgres service

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Letter preview renders all sections correctly
- Edit mode preserves unedited sections
- Version history shows correct sequence
- Export triggers download properly
- Email preparation validates recipients
- WebSocket updates trigger re-renders
- Error states display appropriately
- Mobile responsive layout works

**Component Testing Example:**
```typescript
describe('LetterPreview', () => {
  it('should render letter sections', async () => {
    render(
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <LetterPreview letterId="123" />
      </QueryClientProvider>
    );
    
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText('Re: Smith v. Jones')).toBeInTheDocument();
      expect(screen.getByText('Dear Counsel:')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });
});
```
