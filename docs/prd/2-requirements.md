# 2. Requirements

## Functional Requirements

• **FR1:** The system shall accept and process OCR'd PDF uploads of our Request to Produce (RTP) AND opposing counsel's responses to RTP documents without storing them in the vector database
• **FR2:** The system shall compare RTP request items against both the OC response document and the actual discovery production in the vector database limiting search to just the production batch for what was produced
• **FR3:** The system shall categorize each RTP request item as "Fully Produced", "Partially Produced", "Asserted No Responsive Documents", or "Not Produced" based on the analysis
• **FR4:** The system shall generate a structured deficiency report showing the analysis results with supporting evidence from the vector database
• **FR5:** The system shall provide an interface for legal teams to review, edit, and add contextual notes to the deficiency findings
• **FR6:** The system shall generate 10-day Good Faith letters using predefined templates populated with deficiency findings
• **FR7:** The system shall maintain case isolation ensuring deficiency analysis only accesses documents within the same case
• **FR8:** The system shall emit real-time progress updates via WebSocket during the analysis process
• **FR9:** The deficiency analysis shall automatically trigger upon completion of the fact extraction process in the existing discovery pipeline
• **FR10:** The frontend shall provide upload interfaces for both RTP and OC response documents as part of the discovery processing workflow

## Non-Functional Requirements

• **NFR1:** All analysis operations must maintain the same security and case isolation standards as existing features
• **NFR2:** The system must provide detailed audit logging for all deficiency analysis operations for compliance purposes

## Compatibility Requirements

• **CR1:** The enhancement must integrate seamlessly with the existing discovery processing pipeline without breaking current functionality
• **CR2:** Database schema changes must be backward compatible with existing case and document structures
• **CR3:** New UI components must follow the existing design patterns and component library used in the frontend
• **CR4:** API endpoints must follow the existing RESTful patterns and authentication mechanisms

## Integration Flow Requirements

• **IR1:** The discovery processing pipeline shall maintain uploaded RTP and OC response documents throughout the processing lifecycle
• **IR2:** The fact extraction completion event shall trigger the deficiency analysis process with access to the uploaded documents
• **IR3:** The system shall maintain production batch metadata to properly scope searches to specific discovery productions
• **IR4:** WebSocket events for deficiency analysis shall follow the existing discovery processing event patterns
