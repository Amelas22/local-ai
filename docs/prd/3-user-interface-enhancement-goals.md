# 3. User Interface Enhancement Goals

## Integration with Existing UI

The deficiency analysis interface will integrate into the existing discovery processing workflow:
- **Upload Integration**: Extend current discovery upload interface to include RTP (already exists, but no backend processing exists) and OC response document fields (NYI)
- **Progress Visualization**: Use existing WebSocket-based progress indicators for deficiency analysis stages
- **Report Display**: Follow existing document viewer patterns for displaying the deficiency report
- **Edit Interface**: Leverage existing form components for adding contextual notes and edits

## Modified/New Screens and Views

1. **Enhanced Discovery Upload View**
   - Add file upload fields for RTP document (PDF) (exists, but no backend processing exists)
   - Add file upload field for OC Response document (PDF) 
   - Integrate with existing discovery batch upload flow

2. **Deficiency Analysis Progress View**
   - Real-time progress indicator showing analysis stages
   - Display current RTP item being analyzed
   - Show preliminary categorization results as they complete

3. **Deficiency Report Review Interface**
   - Tabular view of all RTP items with their categorization
   - Expandable rows showing supporting evidence from vector database
   - Inline editing capabilities for legal team annotations
   - Bulk actions for updating categorizations

4. **Good Faith Letter Preview/Edit View**
   - Template-based letter preview with populated deficiency findings
   - Rich text editor for customizing letter content
   - Version tracking for letter drafts
   - Export options (PDF, Word)

## UI Consistency Requirements

- **Component Library**: All new UI elements must use the existing React component library
- **Design Tokens**: Follow established color schemes, typography, and spacing standards
- **Interaction Patterns**: Maintain consistent click, hover, and keyboard navigation behaviors
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure all new views work on tablet and desktop viewports
- **Accessibility**: Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards matching existing application
- **Loading States**: Use existing skeleton screens and loading spinners
- **Error Handling**: Display errors using established toast/alert patterns
