## Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type:** ✓ New Feature Addition

**Enhancement Description:**
This enhancement extends the existing discovery processing pipeline by adding intelligent deficiency analysis capabilities. After fact extraction completes, the system will automatically analyze our Request to Produce (RTP) against the discovery productions and opposing counsel responses, identify gaps and partial productions, generate comprehensive deficiency reports, and automate the drafting of 10-day Good Faith letters.

**Impact Assessment:** ✓ Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes)

## Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
- Extend discovery processing pipeline to automatically trigger deficiency analysis after fact extraction completes (discovery:completed event).
- Automate discovery deficiency detection by comparing RTP requests with actual productions and OC responses
- Generate comprehensive deficiency reports identifying fully produced, partially produced, OC not in possession, and missing documents
- Enable legal teams to review and annotate findings with additional context
- Automate drafting of 10-day Good Faith letters based on deficiency findings
- Reduce manual review time from hours/days to minutes
- Ensure compliance with discovery obligations and deadlines

**Background Context:**
The Discovery Deficiency Analysis feature enables automated comparison between a separately uploaded Request to Produce (RFP), the associated discovery response text, and a set of responsive discovery documents received from opposing counsel. Its core objective is to produce a structured deficiency report that attorneys can use to draft a Good Faith 10-Day Letter.

In the existing manual workflow, attorneys must read through each RFP, locate opposing counsel’s written response, and determine whether responsive documents were provided — all while under tight court deadlines. This feature streamlines that process by:

- Embedding only the responsive documents into a vector store for RAG-based semantic matching
- Parsing the RFP and opposing counsel’s written responses from separate uploads
- Comparing each RFP item and its corresponding response to the discovery corpus
- Generating a categorized report for review and export

Each request is classified under one of four outcome categories:

- Fully Produced – All requested items appear to be satisfied
- Partially Produced – Some items were matched, but not all
- Not Produced – No responsive content found
- Asserted No Responsive Documents – Opposing counsel states that no documents exist within their custody, control, or possession
