**Epic Goal**: Enable automated analysis of discovery productions against RTP requests, generate comprehensive deficiency reports, and draft Good Faith letters to streamline the discovery compliance process.

**Integration Requirements**: 
- Seamless integration with existing discovery processing pipeline
- Maintain case isolation and security standards
- Preserve existing discovery processing functionality
- Enable feature flag for gradual rollout

## Story 1.1: Create Deficiency Analysis Data Models and Service Foundation

As a developer,

- IV2: Ensure search is properly scoped to production batch
- IV3: Confirm no cross-case data leakage in search results

## Story 1.5: Create Deficiency Report Generation System

As a legal team member,
I want to receive a structured deficiency report,
so that I can review and understand what was not properly produced.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Implement report generator that formats analysis results
2: Include summary statistics (total requests, compliance breakdown)
3: Provide detailed findings for each RTP request with evidence and citations including bates numbers and/or page numbers
4: Generate report in both JSON and human-readable formats
5: Store report data for later retrieval and editing

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Ensure report generation doesn't interfere with existing processes
- IV2: Verify WebSocket events properly communicate report generation progress
- IV3: Confirm report storage follows existing document patterns

## Story 1.6: Implement Deficiency Analysis Trigger After Fact Extraction

As a system administrator,
I want deficiency analysis to automatically start after fact extraction,
so that the process is seamless and requires no manual intervention.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Add completion hook to fact extraction process
2: Implement automatic triggering of deficiency analysis
3: Handle cases where RTP/OC documents are not provided
4: Add feature flag (ENABLE_DEFICIENCY_ANALYSIS) for controlled rollout
5: Implement proper error handling and recovery

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Verify fact extraction completion is not delayed
- IV2: Test graceful degradation when deficiency analysis fails
- IV3: Ensure discovery pipeline continues even if analysis is disabled

## Story 1.7: Build Frontend Components for Report Review and Editing

As a legal team member,
I want to review and edit the deficiency report findings,
so that I can add context and correct any misunderstandings.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Create React components for deficiency report display
2: Implement inline editing for categorizations and notes
3: Add bulk actions for updating multiple items
4: Include evidence expansion/collapse functionality
5: Implement save functionality with optimistic updates

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Verify components use existing design system
- IV2: Ensure WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- IV3: Confirm compatibility with existing authentication/authorization

## Story 1.8: Create Good Faith Letter Template System

As a developer,
I want to implement a template system for Good Faith letters,
so that we can generate jurisdiction-appropriate letters.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Create template storage and retrieval system
2: Implement template variables for dynamic content insertion
3: Support multiple letter formats (formal, informal, etc.)
4: Add template versioning for compliance tracking
5: Create default templates for common jurisdictions

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Ensure templates follow existing document storage patterns
- IV2: Verify template system doesn't conflict with motion templates
- IV3: Confirm proper case isolation for template access

## Story 1.9: Implement Good Faith Letter Generation Agent

## Story Sequence Rationale

This story sequence is designed to minimize risk to your existing system:

1. **Foundation First (1.1-1.3)**: Establish data models and parsing without touching existing code
2. **Core Functionality (1.4-1.6)**: Build analysis capabilities with careful integration points
3. **User Interface (1.7, 1.10)**: Add frontend only after backend is stable
4. **Advanced Features (1.8-1.9)**: Letter generation as final enhancement
5. **Quality Assurance (1.11)**: Comprehensive testing before release

Each story can be deployed independently while maintaining system integrity, and the feature flag allows gradual rollout with immediate rollback capability if issues arise.
