### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type:** ✓ New Feature Addition

**Enhancement Description:**
This enhancement extends the existing discovery processing pipeline by adding intelligent deficiency analysis capabilities. After fact extraction completes, the system will automatically analyze our Request to Produce (RTP) against the discovery productions and opposing counsel responses, identify gaps and partial productions, generate comprehensive deficiency reports, and automate the drafting of 10-day Good Faith letters.

**Impact Assessment:** ✓ Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes)

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
- Extend discovery processing pipeline to automatically trigger deficiency analysis after fact extraction completes (discovery:completed event).
- Automate discovery deficiency detection by comparing RTP requests with actual productions and OC responses
- Generate comprehensive deficiency reports identifying fully produced, partially produced, OC not in possession, and missing documents
- Enable legal teams to review and annotate findings with additional context
- Automate drafting of 10-day Good Faith letters based on deficiency findings
- Reduce manual review time from hours/days to minutes
- Ensure compliance with discovery obligations and deadlines

**Background Context:**
The Discovery Deficiency Analysis feature enables automated comparison between a separately uploaded Request to Produce (RFP), the associated discovery response text, and a set of responsive discovery documents received from opposing counsel. Its core objective is to produce a structured deficiency report that attorneys can use to draft a Good Faith 10-Day Letter.

In the existing manual workflow, attorneys must read through each RFP, locate opposing counsel’s written response, and determine whether responsive documents were provided — all while under tight court deadlines. This feature streamlines that process by:

- Embedding only the responsive documents into a vector store for RAG-based semantic matching
- Parsing the RFP and opposing counsel’s written responses from separate uploads
- Comparing each RFP item and its corresponding response to the discovery corpus
- Generating a categorized report for review and export

Each request is classified under one of four outcome categories:

- Fully Produced – All requested items appear to be satisfied
- Partially Produced – Some items were matched, but not all
- Not Produced – No responsive content found
- Asserted No Responsive Documents – Opposing counsel states that no documents exist within their custody, control, or possession

  services/
    deficiency_service.py        # Business logic for deficiency workflow
    tests/
      test_deficiency_service.py
```

**Naming Conventions**: 
- Follow existing snake_case for files and functions
- PascalCase for classes and Pydantic models
- Descriptive names following existing patterns (e.g., DeficiencyAnalyzer, GoodFaithLetterAgent)

**Coding Standards**:

- Large RTP documents may exceed token limits - Mitigated by chunking and windowing strategies
- Performance impact on existing pipeline - Mitigated by async processing and optional feature flag

**Integration Risks**:
- WebSocket event conflicts - Mitigated by namespaced event names (deficiency:*)
- Discovery pipeline failure affecting deficiency analysis - Mitigated by graceful degradation and error recovery

**Deployment Risks**:
- Breaking existing discovery processing - Mitigated by extensive integration testing and feature flag
- API rate limits from increased AI usage - Mitigated by request queuing and cost tracking

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive error handling with fallback to manual process
- Detailed audit logging for compliance requirements
- Phased rollout with monitoring at each stage
- Ability to disable feature without affecting core discovery processing

## 5. Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single epic approach with rationale

The deficiency analysis feature is a cohesive enhancement to the existing discovery pipeline. All components (analysis, report, letter generation) are tightly integrated, and a single epic ensures proper sequencing and dependency management while reducing the risk of partial implementation affecting the discovery workflow.

## 6. Epic 1: Discovery Deficiency Analysis and Good Faith Letter Generation

**Epic Goal**: Enable automated analysis of discovery productions against RTP requests, generate comprehensive deficiency reports, and draft Good Faith letters to streamline the discovery compliance process.

**Integration Requirements**: 
- Seamless integration with existing discovery processing pipeline
- Maintain case isolation and security standards
- Preserve existing discovery processing functionality
- Enable feature flag for gradual rollout

### Story Sequence Rationale

This story sequence is designed to minimize risk to your existing system:

1. **Foundation First (1.1-1.3)**: Establish data models and parsing without touching existing code
2. **Core Functionality (1.4-1.6)**: Build analysis capabilities with careful integration points
3. **User Interface (1.7, 1.10)**: Add frontend only after backend is stable
4. **Advanced Features (1.8-1.9)**: Letter generation as final enhancement
5. **Quality Assurance (1.11)**: Comprehensive testing before release

Each story can be deployed independently while maintaining system integrity, and the feature flag allows gradual rollout with immediate rollback capability if issues arise.
