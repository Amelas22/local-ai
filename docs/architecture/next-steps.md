# Next Steps

After completing this brownfield architecture:

1. Review integration points with existing system
2. Begin story implementation with Dev agent
3. Set up deployment pipeline integration
4. Plan rollback and monitoring procedures

## Story Manager Handoff

For the Story Manager to work with this brownfield enhancement:

**Reference Documents:**
- Architecture: `/docs/architecture.md` (this document)
- PRD: `/docs/prd.md` (Discovery Deficiency Analysis requirements)
- Existing patterns: `/CLAUDE.md` (coding guidelines)

**Key Integration Requirements:**
- Hook into existing discovery pipeline via `discovery:completed` event
- Maintain case isolation using existing `case_name` patterns
- Use existing JWT authentication and case context middleware
- Follow vertical slice architecture with co-located tests

**System Constraints:**
- PostgreSQL only (no Supabase references)
- Must not break existing discovery processing
- Feature flag `ENABLE_DEFICIENCY_ANALYSIS` controls rollout
- All new files follow existing naming conventions

**First Story to Implement:**
Story 1.1: Create Deficiency Analysis Data Models and Service Foundation
- Critical foundation piece with no dependencies
- Establishes patterns for remaining stories
- Can be tested in isolation
- Low risk to existing system

**Emphasis:** Maintain existing system integrity by using feature flag and ensuring all deficiency operations are optional additions to the discovery pipeline.

## Developer Handoff

For developers starting implementation:

**Architecture & Standards:**
- Architecture: `/docs/architecture.md` - Complete technical design
- Coding standards: Follow patterns in `/CLAUDE.md` and existing codebase
- Use `ruff` for formatting, type hints required, Google-style docstrings

**Integration Requirements:**
- Import existing components: `QdrantVectorStore`, `EmbeddingGenerator`, `pdf_extractor`
- Use logger pattern: `logger = get_logger("clerk_api")`
- Case isolation: Always filter by `case_name` in all queries
- WebSocket events: Use `deficiency:*` namespace

**Technical Decisions:**
- Async processing to avoid blocking discovery pipeline
- JSON storage for flexible evidence data
- PostgreSQL for relational data integrity
- Reuse existing PDF processing libraries

**Compatibility Verification:**
1. Run full discovery test suite before and after changes
2. Verify discovery works with `ENABLE_DEFICIENCY_ANALYSIS=false`
3. Test case isolation with multiple concurrent analyses
4. Ensure no performance regression in discovery processing

**Implementation Sequence:**
1. Database migrations (backward compatible)
2. Core models and service (no external dependencies)
3. Integration hooks (feature flagged)
4. UI components (progressive enhancement)
5. End-to-end testing with real data

This architecture provides a solid foundation for implementing the Discovery Deficiency Analysis feature while maintaining the integrity and performance of the existing Clerk Legal AI System.
