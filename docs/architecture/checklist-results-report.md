# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary
- **Overall architecture readiness:** High
- **Critical risks identified:** None - following existing patterns minimizes risk
- **Key strengths:** Leverages all existing infrastructure, clear integration points, feature flag safety
- **Project type:** Full-stack enhancement (backend services + frontend components)

## Section Analysis

**Requirements Alignment (100%)**
- ✅ All functional requirements from PRD addressed
- ✅ Non-functional requirements (security, performance) integrated
- ✅ Technical constraints respected (no Supabase, PostgreSQL only)

**Architecture Fundamentals (100%)**
- ✅ Clear component diagrams and interactions
- ✅ Separation of concerns maintained
- ✅ Follows existing vertical slice pattern
- ✅ Modular design for independent development

**Technical Stack (100%)**
- ✅ No new technologies introduced
- ✅ Existing stack fully leveraged
- ✅ Version compatibility maintained

**Implementation Guidance (100%)**
- ✅ Coding standards match existing patterns
- ✅ Testing strategy defined
- ✅ Clear file organization

**Security & Compliance (100%)**
- ✅ JWT authentication reused
- ✅ Case isolation maintained
- ✅ Audit logging included
- ✅ No cross-case data leakage

## Risk Assessment

1. **OCR Quality** (Medium) - PRD mentions OCR'd documents but architecture assumes readable PDFs
   - Mitigation: Add OCR quality validation in RTPParser
2. **Token Limits** (Low) - Large RTP documents may exceed AI model limits
   - Mitigation: Implement chunking strategy for analysis
3. **Performance** (Low) - Analysis may be slow for large productions
   - Mitigation: Async processing with progress updates

## AI Implementation Readiness
- **Clarity:** Excellent - follows existing patterns exactly
- **Complexity:** Low - simple components with clear responsibilities
- **Implementation order:** Well-defined story sequence minimizes risk
