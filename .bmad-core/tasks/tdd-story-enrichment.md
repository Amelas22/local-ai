# TDD Story Enrichment Task

## Purpose

To enrich user stories with comprehensive Test-Driven Development (TDD) requirements, ensuring every story includes clear test scenarios, coverage expectations, and guidance for test-first implementation. This task transforms standard stories into TDD-ready stories that enable developers to follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle from the start.

## Prerequisites

- An existing story file (draft or in-progress)
- Understanding of the story's acceptance criteria
- Access to architecture documentation for testing standards
- Familiarity with TDD principles from test-engineer guide

## Task Execution

### 1. Load Story and Context

- Load the current story file from `{devStoryLocation}/{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md`
- Review the story statement, acceptance criteria, and existing Dev Notes
- Load testing standards from architecture documentation
- Reference `.bmad-core/agents/test-engineer.md` for TDD principles

### 2. Analyze Story for Testability

For each acceptance criterion and task in the story:

- Identify the testable behaviors and outcomes
- Determine test boundaries (unit, integration, e2e)
- Flag any acceptance criteria that are vague or untestable
- Note dependencies that affect testing approach

### 3. Generate TDD Test Scenarios

For each testable component, create test scenarios following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

#### 3.1 Red Phase Scenarios (Tests to Write First)
```markdown
## TDD Test Scenarios

### Unit Tests (Write First)
1. **Test: [Component/Function Name] - [Behavior]**
   - **Given:** [Initial state/setup]
   - **When:** [Action taken]
   - **Then:** [Expected outcome]
   - **Coverage Focus:** [What this validates]

2. **Test: [Error Handling Scenario]**
   - **Given:** [Error condition setup]
   - **When:** [Triggering action]
   - **Then:** [Expected error handling]
   - **Coverage Focus:** [Edge case coverage]
```

#### 3.2 Implementation Guidance (Green Phase)
- Minimal code needed to pass each test
- Order of implementation based on test dependencies
- Specific patterns from architecture to follow

#### 3.3 Refactoring Opportunities (Refactor Phase)
- Code quality improvements after tests pass
- Performance optimizations to consider
- Design pattern applications

### 4. Define Coverage Requirements

Based on story complexity and criticality:

```markdown
## Test Coverage Requirements

### Minimum Coverage Targets
- **Overall Coverage:** 80% (minimum)
- **Critical Paths:** 100% coverage required for:
  - [List critical functionality]
  - [Security-related code]
  - [Data validation logic]
- **Edge Cases:** Comprehensive coverage for:
  - [Boundary conditions]
  - [Error scenarios]
  - [Invalid inputs]

### Coverage Exceptions
- [Any justified exceptions with reasoning]
```

### 5. Create Test Implementation Plan

Structure the test-first approach:

```markdown
## TDD Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Tests (Write First)
1. [ ] Write test for [basic functionality]
2. [ ] Implement minimal code to pass
3. [ ] Refactor for clarity

### Phase 2: Feature Tests (Incremental)
1. [ ] Write test for [feature aspect]
2. [ ] Extend implementation
3. [ ] Refactor and optimize

### Phase 3: Edge Case Tests
1. [ ] Write tests for error conditions
2. [ ] Implement error handling
3. [ ] Refactor for robustness
```

### 6. Update Story with TDD Requirements

Enhance the story file with TDD information:

- **Update Dev Notes/Testing Section:**
  - Add generated test scenarios
  - Include coverage requirements
  - Provide TDD implementation plan
  - Reference testing frameworks and patterns

- **Update Tasks/Subtasks:**
  - Prepend "Write test for..." tasks before implementation tasks
  - Add explicit refactoring tasks after green phase
  - Include coverage verification tasks

- **Add TDD Checklist:**
  ```markdown
  ### TDD Checklist
  - [ ] All tests written before implementation
  - [ ] Each test fails initially (Red)
  - [ ] Minimal code to pass tests (Green)
  - [ ] Code refactored with passing tests (Refactor)
  - [ ] Coverage targets met (80%+ overall)
  - [ ] Critical paths have 100% coverage
  ```

### 7. Validate TDD Completeness

Review the enriched story to ensure:

- Every acceptance criterion has corresponding test scenarios
- Test scenarios follow Given-When-Then format
- Coverage requirements are specific and measurable
- Implementation follows test-first approach
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle is clearly defined

### 8. Generate TDD Summary

Provide a summary of TDD enhancements:

```markdown
## TDD Enhancement Summary

**Test Scenarios Added:** [count]
**Coverage Target:** [percentage]
**Critical Paths Identified:** [count]
**TDD Phases Defined:** Red ([count] tests) → Green (implementation) → Refactor

**Key Testing Focus Areas:**
- [Primary test focus 1]
- [Primary test focus 2]
- [Primary test focus 3]

**Next Steps:**
1. Developer starts with writing the [count] unit tests defined
2. Implements code incrementally to pass each test
3. Refactors after all tests pass
4. Achieves [percentage]% coverage target
```
